	abstract = {Due to the increasing volume of user-generated content on the web, the vast majority of businesses and organizations have focused their interest on sentiment analysis in order to gain insights and information about their customers. Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing task that aims to extract information about the human emotional state. Specifically, sentiment analysis can be achieved on three different levels, namely at the document level, sentence level or the aspect/feature level. Since document and sentence levels can be too generic for an opinion estimation given specific attributes of a product or service, aspect-based sentiment analysis became the norm regarding the exploitation of user generated data. However, most human languages, with the exception of the English language, are considered low-resource languages due to the restricted resources available, leading to challenges in automating information extraction tasks. Accordingly, in this work, we propose a methodology for automatic aspect extraction and sentiment classification on Greek texts that can potentially be generalized to other low-resource languages. For the purpose of this study, a new dataset was created consisting of social media posts explicitly written in the Greek language from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. We further propose Transformer-based Deep Learning architectures that are able to automatically extract the key aspects from texts and then classify them according to the author’s intent into three pre-defined classification categories. The results of the proposed methodology achieved relatively high F1-macro scores on all the classes denoting the importance of the proposed methodology on aspect extraction and sentiment classification on low-resource languages. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine how dynamic pricing impacts customer perceptions of restaurants and sentiment toward prices via online reputation metrics. In addition, to deepen the debate on dynamic pricing, a novel definition is drawn by exploring the specific forms of discrimination that can manifest in different industries. Design/methodology/approach: Leveraging a comprehensive data set of restaurant reviews sourced from TripAdvisor, the study focuses on restaurants affiliated with one of the largest groups of restaurants in Spain. We used a quasi-experimental method (difference-in-differences), to study how dynamic pricing strategies influence customers’ perceptions of value based on numerical ratings. Meanwhile, we used a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model on the textual component of reviews to dissect the emotional nuances of dynamic pricing. Findings: Results did not reveal a causal impact of dynamic pricing strategies on customers’ perceptions. Moreover, the sentiment analysis shows no heightened negative view after introducing dynamic pricing in restaurants compared to the control group. Contrary to what previous literature suggests, our findings indicate that implementing dynamic pricing does not adversely affect customers’ perceptions or sentiments regarding prices in restaurants. Research limitations/implications: The quasi-experimental setting of the study presents inherent challenges in establishing causality that require further investigation using controlled experimental settings. Nevertheless, our study reveals that restaurant customers do not perceive dynamic pricing as unfair. This finding is critical for restaurant managers when considering the implementation of dynamic pricing and revenue management strategies. In addition, our study highlights the importance of considering not only numerical ratings but customer sentiment analysis as well. This more holistic approach to assessing the impact of pricing strategies can give restaurant managers a deeper understanding of customer reactions. In addition, a more rigorous definition of dynamic pricing is provided, clarifying its nature and its distinction in using different price discrimination. Originality/value: This study contributes to the evolving understanding of dynamic pricing strategies’ impact on customers’ perceptions and sentiments in the restaurant industry. It aims to fill the gap in understanding customer reactions to algorithmically determined prices (via revenue management systems such as DynamEat) in this industry. The combination of causal inference and sentiment analysis offers a novel perspective, shedding light on the nuanced connections between dynamic pricing implementation and customers’ emotions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper is intended to evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art transformer models, including BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, Transformer XL, and RoBERTa, for multiclass emotion detection using the IEMOCAP dataset. From the results, it is observed that DistilBERT has the highest accuracy of 79.2%, implying an effective approach in balancing model size and performance. These research show that smaller models like DistilBERT often outperform larger models by reducing their overfitting and computational demands.

It is important for entrepreneurs to effectively analyze customer reviews. From the perspective of BNB managers, it is necessary to know customer opinions relating to specific aspects of the services they have received. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) evaluates customer sentiments and opinions and can be used to improve services. We propose a framework for automated ABSA of reviews. The framework contains modules for data preprocessing, a multi-task Chinese aspect-based sentiment analysis module, and a Kano module. The Kano module divided service attributes into several distinct categories including must-be, one-dimensional, and attractive attributes… and so on. This module is integrated into our analytical framework to elucidate the relationships between hotel service offerings and customer attributes. The framework is used for a dataset crawled from Google Maps hotel reviews with aspect categories labeled by domain experts. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of this method. We categorize customer requirements based on the aggregate consumer preferences estimated by the Kano module. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in an empirical evaluation and the utility of the proposed Kano module demonstrated. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

This study uses methodologies such as Sentence-BERT (SBERT), TF-IDF, spectral clustering, t-SNE, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and bootstrap distribution to investigate how semantic variances in reviews could be used for personalized shopping experiences. It reveals that incentive reviews have minimal to no impact on purchasing decisions, which is consistent with the credibility and consistency analysis in terms of volume, length, and content. The negligible impact of incentive reviews on purchase decisions underscores the importance of authentic online feedback.

Consequently, the internet has become inundated with a vast array of both pertinent and extraneous information, presenting a formidable challenge in sifting through the abundance of content to extract the desired information. Sentiment analysis emerges as a valuable tool for addressing this issue, enabling the systematic analysis of each document to discern the prevailing sentiment expressed within. This holds particular relevance in the realm of customer decision-making, as it empowers individuals to make informed choices when selecting the most suitable US airline by evaluating the opinions shared by other customers on online review platforms like Skytrax and micro-blogging sites such as Twitter. We can use these kinds of datasets to provides the aspect level sentiment analysis. Therefore, we have explored, in this article, a language model built upon a pretrained deep neural networks capable of analyzing the sequence of text to classify it as having positive, negative or neutral emotions without explicit human labelling. To analyze and assess these models, data from Twitter’s US airlines sentiment database was used. Experiment on above data set show BERT model to be superior in accuracy while being more significant in less time to train.

First, a summary of the importance and role of text analysis in information retrieval is presented. The study then looks at text pre-processing methods such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word elimination. Additionally, other NLP techniques are investigated, including sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity identification. The following section of the study looks at several text representation models, such as word embeddings, TF-IDF, and bag-of-words. Text analytics is the process of interpreting unorganized textual material and converting it into useful data for study in order to provide a measurable number that provides some crucial information. Text analysis is being used by businesses more and more. It helps with the research of unstructured information, such as customer feedback, as well as the identification of patterns and trend predictions. Solutions, databases, analysis, automated process programs, data gathering, and extraction-based tools are only a few examples of the technology solutions for text analysis that are available for converting text data into meaningful data for analysis. This research will cover the principles of textual data, several text mining methodologies, and the most popular text analysis tools. We examine text categorization methods including Support Machines, Deep Learning and Naive Bayes, Information retrieval systems, NLP tools and libraries, text summarization strategies, and case examples in diverse disciplines, which are covered in the conclusion. An overview of text analysis for information retrieval using NLP methods is the goal of this research. Information retrieval systems, NLP tools, text summarization, text representation models, text classification, text similarity measures, and text pre-processing are all covered in the study.

The evolution of e-commerce reviews toward a multimodal format, including images, videos, and emojis, introduces new dimensions to sentiment analysis. Traditional text-based models may struggle to effectively capture sentiments expressed through non-textual elements. This paper proposed an effective sentiment analysis model for the E-Commerce Platform to improve the user consumer experience. The proposed method comprises Fejer Kernel filtering for data points estimation in the E-commerce dataset points. Within the estimated data points fuzzy dictionary-based semantic word feature extraction is performed for the estimation of features in the E-Commerce dataset. The dataset for the analysis is computed with the Optimized Stimulated Annealing for the feature extraction and selection. The classification of customer opinion is classified with the BERT deep learning model. The feature extracted from the model is the opinion of consumers in the E-Commerce dataset. The classification of consumer preference experience is based on opinion of customers in the E-commerce dataset. Simulation results demonstrated that proposed model achieves the higher classification accuracy for the E-Commerce platform. © Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, predicting customer churn is essential for the success of any company. Loyal customers generate continuous revenue streams, resulting in long-term success and growth. Moreover, companies are increasingly prioritizing the retention of existing customers due to the higher costs associated with attracting new ones. Consequently, there has been a growing demand for advanced methods aimed at enhancing customer loyalty and satisfaction, as well as predicting churners. In our work, we focused on building a robust churn prediction model for the telecommunications industry based on large embeddings from large language models and logistic regression to accurately identify churners. We conducted extensive experiments using a range of embedding techniques, including OpenAI Text-embedding, Google Gemini Text Embedding, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Sentence-Transformers, Sent2vec, and Doc2vec, to extract meaningful features. Additionally, we tested various classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, decision tree, and zero-shot classification, to build a robust model capable of making accurate predictions. The best-performing model in our experiments is the logistic regression classifier, which we trained using the extracted feature from the OpenAI Text-embedding-ada-002 model, achieving an accuracy of 89%. The proposed model demonstrates a high discriminative ability between churning and loyal customers. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of social media has rendered it a critical arena for online marketing strategies. To optimize conversion rates, the landing pages must effectively respond to a visitor segment’s pain points that they need solutions for. A one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate since even if the product meets the needs of all consumers, their priorities may diverge. In this study, we propose a pipeline for creating personalized landing pages that dynamically cater to visiting customers’ specific concerns. As a use case, a pipeline will be utilized to create a personalized pharmacy discount card landing page, serving for the particular needs of chronic diabetic users seeking to purchase needed medications at a reduced cost. The proposed pipeline incorporates additional stages to augment the traditional online marketing funnel, including acquisition of salient tweets, filtration of irrelevant ones, extracting themes from relevant tweets, and generating coherent paragraphs. To collect relevant tweets and reduce bias, Facebook groups and pages relevant to individuals with diabetes are leveraged. Pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and sentence transformers are used to cluster the tweets based on their similarities. GuidedLDA exhibits superior performance in identifying customer priorities. Human evaluations reveal that personalized landing pages are more effective in getting attention and building attraction by addressing their concerns and engaging the audiences. The proposed methodology offers a practical architecture for developing customized landing pages considering visiting customers’ profiles and needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

Intelligent systems that can identify online social advocates based on their social interaction and long-standing conversations with the brads are still lacking. This study adds to the burgeoning body of literature in this research area by developing a novel model to identify brand advocates using natural language inference (NLI) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. In particular, a hybridised deep learning model (BERT-BiLSTM-TextCNN) is proposed and adept at extracting the amount of entailment, contradiction, and neutrality obtained from the advocates' replies to the brands. This offers a new dimension to identify advocates based on the semantic similarities between the brands’ tweets and customers’ replies. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of integrating the advantages of fine-tuned BERT, TextCNN, and BiLSTM using various evaluation metrics. Further, the proposed model is incorporated in a downstream task to verify and validate its effectiveness in capturing the correlation between brands and their advocates. Our findings contribute to the burgeoning body of literature in this research area and have important implications for identifying and engaging with brand advocates in online customer engagement. © The Author(s) 2023.},

This study demonstrates the efficacy of NLP-powered sentiment analysis in interpreting customer complaints and promptly addressing customer satisfaction issues. Entity identification is also beneficial for identifying patterns in client feedback, which can be utilized to enhance the product and attract new customers. The findings of our study highlight the superior performance of the ElecTRa model over other evaluated models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score; specifically, th e El ecTRa model ex hibited an average ROC AUC score of 0.93. Automatically classifying customer notifications as complaints or non-complaints enables the monitoring of customer representatives' performance, facilitating targeted training in-terventions to address any identified shortcomings and improve service quality. By pinpointing specific issues where mistakes were made, organizations can effectively tailor training programs to enhance the skills and effectiveness of customer representatives in handling customer concerns. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the ever-expanding digital landscape, the abundance of user-generated content on consumer platforms such as Booking and TripAdvisor offers a rich source of information for both travellers and hoteliers. Sentiment analysis, a fundamental research task of natural language processing (NLP) is used for mining sentiments and opinions within this vast reservoir of text reviews. A more specific type of sentiment analysis, i.e., aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), is used when processing customer reviews is required. In ABSA, we aim to capture aspect-level sentiments and intricate relationships between various aspects within reviews. This article proposes a novel approach to ABSA by introducing a novel technique of word sense disambiguation (WSD) and integrating it with the Transformer architecture bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The proposed approach resolves the intriguing ambiguities of the words and represents the review data as a complex graph structure, facilitating the modeling of intricate relationships between different aspects. The combination of bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and GCN proves effective in capturing inter-dependencies among various aspects, providing a nuanced understanding of customer sentiments. The experiments are conducted on the RABSA dataset (an enhanced and richer hotel review data collection), and results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of integrating WSD in ABSA. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the significant contribution of the WSD module to the overall performance. Moreover, we explore different similarity measures and find that cosine similarity yields the best results when identifying the real sense of a word in a given sentence using WordNet. The findings of our work and future work related to our work create lots of interest for people in the tourism and hospitality industry. This research gives another boost to the concept of the potential of NLP techniques in sentiment analysis. It emphasizes that if we combine the potential of NLP techniques along with state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, we can shape the future of this field. Copyright 2025 Nadeem et al.},

	abstract = {The exponential augmentation of digitally-produced data engendered daily manifests substantial obstacles and fa-vorable prospects. With the proliferation of social media, e-commerce, and online reviews, comprehending the sentiments and viewpoints articulated by individuals has become pivotal for enterprises, policymakers, and scholars. Therefore, this study explores the development of a sentiment analysis system for the Wolaita language, which can enable social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and decision support systems that cater to the needs and concerns of Wolaita-speaking communities. For this reason, a Wolaita language sentiment dataset was constructed by collecting and annotating texts from divers data sources, including religious materials, textbooks, news articles and social media posts. The proposed system was evaluated using a range of machine learning models, encompassing Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), and transformer-based architectures, as well as feature engineering techniques like n-grams and sentiment lexicons to determine the most efficacious approach for Wolaita language sentiment analysis. The transformer-based models, specifically a Wolaita-language BERT model, achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 0.82 for classifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. The study ascertained that transfer learning from higher-resource languages assisted in surmounting the data sparsity impediments for Wolaita. This work demonstrates the feasibility of developing accurate sentiment analysis capabilities for the Wolaita language leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, despite the language's low-resource status. Prospective work will entail augmenting the dataset and exploring semi-supervised learning to enhance the performance of the system.  © 2024 IEEE.},

While user-generated reviews on e-commerce platforms provide timely and unbiased feedback, the unstructured nature and high volume of such textual data pose significant challenges for extracting actionable insights. This study investigates the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically topic modeling and text classification, to address this issue. In the first phase of the study, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic to identify latent topics within customer reviews, providing a thematic overview of customer discussions. Due to the bad performance of these models, manual labeling was introduced in the second phase based on the topics identified in the initial step. The final classification model was developed using PhoBERT embeddings combined with Logistic Regression. The experiments were conducted on a dataset of 17,002 Vietnamese customer reviews from Shopee, one of Vietnam’s largest e-commerce platforms. The model successfully categorized reviews into five primary topics: Product Quality, Customer Service, Price, Shipping, and Packaging, achieving an F1-score of 0.96 and a Hamming Loss of 0.022. This result helps e-commerce managers identify customer issues, allowing for effective improvements in the buying experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.},

	abstract = {Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon involving humor, criticism, or phrases that convey the opposite meaning, mask true feelings, and play pivotal roles in various aspects of communication. Therefore, identifying sarcasm is essential for sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and customer service, as it enables a better understanding of public sentiment. Moreover, social media has become a primary platform for people to express their feelings and opinions and provide feedback to businesses and service providers. Misinterpreting sarcasm in customer feedback can lead to incorrect responses and actions. However, accurately detecting sarcasm is challenging because it depends on context, cultural factors, and inherent ambiguity. Despite the plenty of research and resources in Machine Learning (ML) for detecting sarcasm in English, including Deep Learning (DL) techniques, there is still a shortage of research in sarcasm detection in Arabic, particularly in DL methodologies and available sarcastic datasets. This paper constructed a new Arabic sarcastic corpus and fine-tuned three pre-trained Arabic transformer-based Language Models (LM) for Arabic sarcasm detection. We also proposed a hybrid DL approach for sarcasm detection that combines static and contextualized representations using pre-trained LM, such as Word2Vec word embeddings and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models pretrained on Arabic resources. The proposed enhanced hybrid deep learning approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by 8% on a shared benchmark dataset and achieves a 5% improvement in F1-score on another. © 2024 THE AUTHORS},

	abstract = {Understanding customer sentiment through product reviews is important for businesses aiming to enhance their products and services. Traditional sentiment analysis often struggles to detect the wide range of emotional nuances, particularly those expressed through emojis, in online reviews. To address this challenge, our paper introduces a novel technique called Emoji-Enhanced BERT (EEBERT) based, on the BERT architecture. The Sentiment Adjustment Factor (SAF), created for emoji tokenization with the embeddings layer, is applied to analyze sentiment and emotion within review text content. Sentiments classification is evaluated using three different methods: (1) evaluating the full review text; (2) analyzing the text with emojis; and (3) integrating star ratings and total votes in EEBERT. These methods were fine-tuned using a labeled Amazon product reviews dataset. The approach utilizes a well-vetted dataset comprising approximately 10 million customer reviews from four different categories. This dataset is condensed to 26,818 reviews to only consider emoji contained reviews, covering 3,275 distinct emojis. A systematic approach to classifying reviews and an innovative technique for assessing the emotional semantics of emojis are developed. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 97.00%, further applies continuous testing via 5-fold cross-validation, achieving an average accuracy of 99.21%, which supports the reliability of the EEBERT model.  © 2024 The Authors.

Understanding the sentiment embedded in such texts is crucial for a range of applications, from improving social media analytics to enhancing customer feedback systems. Despite their significance, research in code-mixed and code-switched languages remains limited, particularly in less-resourced languages. This scarcity of research creates a gap in natural language processing (NLP) technologies, hindering their ability to accurately interpret the rich linguistic diversity of global communications. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel methodology for sentiment analysis in code-mixed and code-switched texts. Our approach combines the power of large language models (LLMs) and the versatility of the multilingual BERT (mBERT) framework to effectively process and analyze sentiments in multilingual data. By decomposing code-mixed texts into their constituent languages, employing mBERT for named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment label prediction, and integrating these insights into a decision-making LLM, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding sentiment in complex linguistic contexts.

This research introduces an extensive AI-based predictive analytics framework aimed at improving customer engagement, retention and satisfaction using advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies. By using XGBoost for churn prediction and BERT-based models for sentiment analysis, the system efficiently handles both structured and unstructured customer data.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score demonstrate the better performance of the proposed system compared to conventional CRM approaches. This work also addresses important issues such as data privacy compliance, algorithmic bias and explainability of AI decision-making. Ethical deployment and transparency of AI are emphasized for building confidence in automated CRM systems. Future evolution will tackle the use of reinforcement learning to facilitate learning-based interaction schemes and federated learning for trusted, decentralized management of data.

	abstract = {Social networks have modernized the way people communicate, share information, and consume content. The widespread use of social media platforms has resulted in the creation of vast amounts of user-generated content, which can be analyzed to gain valuable insights into customer behaviour, emotions, preferences, and trends. Previous studies on online customer engagement have mainly focused on brand perspective and its socially significant elements, such as brand personality, image, reputation, and loyalty. These studies have explored how these elements influence the behavioural engagement of customers, such as their purchase intentions, word-of-mouth recommendations, and repeat purchases. However, more recent research has started to shift towards a more customer-centric perspective, which acknowledges that customer engagement is a two-way process, involving both the brand and the customer. This approach considers the role of customer experiences, emotions, topics of interest, and motivations in shaping their social engagement with the brand. This paper contributes to these endeavours by developing a consolidated framework that incorporates various facets of the customer's emotional and behavioural social content. In particular, features of online customers have been extracted using various sophisticated modules that incorporate natural language inference, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and the Big-Five Personality Traits. Further, a heuristic-based feature selection (FS) strategy, Dual Annealing Optimisation (DAO), is integrated with Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) to furnish a consolidated machine learning module (DAO-LGBM) that is implemented and examined to detect advocates in online customer engagement. A thorough examination of a proposed model and its utility for detecting advocates using rigorous evaluation metrics is undertaken, reported, and discussed. These findings have substantial implications for both academic research and practical applications in social media analytics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Text classification plays a major role in research such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and customer feedback analysis. Text classification using hypergraph algorithms is effective in capturing the intricate relationships between words and phrases in documents. The method entails text preprocessing, keyword extraction, feature selection, text classification, and performance metric evaluation. Here, we proposed a Hypergraph Attention Layer with Logistic Regression (HGATT_LR) for text classification in the Amazon review data set. The essential keywords are extracted by utilizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. To build a hypergraph attention layer, feature selection based on node-level and edge-level attention is assessed. The resultant features are passed as an input of Logistic regression for text classification. Through a comparison analysis of different text classifiers on the Amazon data set, the performance metrics are assessed. Text classification using hypergraph Attention Network has been shown to achieve 88% accuracy which is better compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed model is scalable and may be easily enhanced with more training data. The solution highlights the utility of hypergraph approaches for text classification as well as their applicability to real-world datasets with complicated interactions between text parts. This type of analysis will empower the business people will improve the quality of the product. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Unlike conventional methods relying solely on domain-specific features, our approach incorporates domain-independent features to facilitate knowledge transfer across domains. Through extensive experiments on various datasets including product reviews, social media posts, and news articles, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

	abstract = {As e-commerce continues its rapid expansion, accurately gauging and interpreting customer sentiment has become critical for optimizing user satisfaction and predicting purchasing behavior. This study advances feature-level sentiment analysis by examining Chinese e-commerce product reviews, translated into English, to uncover the contextual impact of sentiment-bearing keywords across diverse product categories. The research intends to discover trends, reasons, and broad conclusions associated with the volume, co-occurrence, and contextual use of keywords across various product types. Using sentiment intensity analysis, N-gram modeling, and machine learning, this research attempted to evaluate the performance of these models: ELECTRA, BERT, BiLSTM, Random Forest with XGBoost, and SVC with SGD. Empirical results demonstrate that ELECTRA yields the highest accuracy (98.09%) and F1 score (0.9711), illustrating superior performance in capturing nuanced sentiment cues, with low loss of 0.062. BiLSTM followed with 96.09% accuracy and F1 score of 0.9583. Although BERT performed strongly with an accuracy of 95.28% and an F1 score of 0.9528, it is extremely resource demanding. Ensemble methods like Random Forest with XGBoost and SVC with SGD had moderate performance, finding 82.43%, and 88.84% accuracy, respectively, but had better runtimes. The results supports the advantage of using transformer based models in attempting more sophisticated contextual analysis by uncovering paramount sentiment patterns, product specific issues, and customer needs. Furthermore, by translating Chinese reviews into English, the study highlights the potential for cross-lingual frameworks to enrich global e-commerce strategies. Future research directions include integrating cultural factors, extending analysis to additional languages, and refining computational approaches for resource-limited environments. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today’s competitive telecom landscape, service providers are increasingly seeking real-time customer experience analysis, prompt responses to customer feedback, and the ability to effectively promote new services. To achieve these goals, telecom operators are embracing digitalization initiatives that encompass the entire customer journey, broadly divided into three phases: engaging, using, and evaluating. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis (SA) techniques have empowered telecom service providers to rapidly analyze and categorize millions of customer tweets, gaining valuable insights into service perceptions and user satisfaction. With a significant presence of telecom service providers in Arab countries, where customers frequently share their service experiences through Arabic tweets, the need for specialized NLP and SA techniques that can effectively handle Arabic language data becomes paramount. This study focuses on Arabic language processing and sentiment analysis to support one of the Middle East’s largest telecom service providers in analyzing and enhancing customer experience. The study successfully applied BERTopic, a topic modeling technique, to Arabic telecom-related text, generating six distinct clusters for 50% of the analyzed tweets. Support vector machine (SVM) outperformed XGBoost as the machine learning classifier when combined with the BERT-base model, achieving an F1-score of 0.71 compared to XGBoost’s 0.65.

This technique is essential in a dissimilarity of applications, with sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and review summarization. The determination of aspect term extraction is to automatically label and classify words or phrases that express aspects of a specific entity, which could be products, services, or any topic under discussion. In ATE, static word embeddings are required to capture dynamic word meanings properly. We designate a original method for dealing with the intricacies of this difficult and enhancing sentiment analysis accuracy, which uses a Multi-level Semantic Relation-enhanced Learning Network (MSRL-Net) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In this paper, we suggest a synergistic framework that uses MSRL-Nets to develop the resolution and clarity of text representations, subsequent by BERT's input format, which is limited to a collection of words and cannot include more context knowledge. MSRL-Net and BERT addresses aspect extraction, sentiment polarity identification, and context-dependent sentiment comprehension by leveraging MSRL-Net's capabilities to create high-resolution text representation and BERT's contextualized language considerate. The combination of MSRL-Nets with BERT designates a promising future path for aspect-based sentiment analysis, with applications such as customer feedback analysis, market research, and social media sentiment monitoring.

	abstract = {Sentimental analysis is one of the most complicated tasks in text mining. It is the process of converting unstructured text to structural text to identify the meaningful pattern of data. Different kinds of sentiments in social media posts are classified into positive and negative. Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an imperative task in examining sentiments on social media. Sentimental analysis techniques frequently use text data to help to monitor customer feedback about products and understand the needs of customers in the field of business. The text data are gathered from social media comments that lead to several drawbacks such as spelling errors, noise, and unstructured data, and some of the data are in abbreviation form in which abbreviations are hard to understand from the text data. Therefore, the innovative sentiment analysis method is implemented to identify the kinds of sentiments from the collected social media posts. At first, the text data are assembled from the social media posts. The collected text data are subjected to text preprocessing techniques to improve the data quality. NLP techniques such as a bag of n-grams, glove embedding, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are applied to separate the features from the text data. The removed features from these techniques are given to the fusion of the optimal feature stage, where the weight optimization takes place via the Mutated Random Parameter-based Serval Optimization Algorithm (MRP-SOA). The attained optimal weighted fused features contain the most relevant information, and it is fed to the classifier for analyzing the sentiments. For analyzing the sentiments, the Cascaded Adaptive Dilated Temporal Convolutional Network (CADTCN) is utilized, and the parameters from ADTCN are optimized with the same to get higher classification outcomes. The analysis outcomes are compared with the traditional sentiment analysis models in terms of various metrics to show the success of the advanced design.  © 2026 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine how dynamic pricing impacts customer perceptions of restaurants and sentiment toward prices via online reputation metrics. In addition, to deepen the debate on dynamic pricing, a novel definition is drawn by exploring the specific forms of discrimination that can manifest in different industries. Design/methodology/approach: Leveraging a comprehensive data set of restaurant reviews sourced from TripAdvisor, the study focuses on restaurants affiliated with one of the largest groups of restaurants in Spain. We used a quasi-experimental method (difference-in-differences), to study how dynamic pricing strategies influence customers’ perceptions of value based on numerical ratings. Meanwhile, we used a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model on the textual component of reviews to dissect the emotional nuances of dynamic pricing. Findings: Results did not reveal a causal impact of dynamic pricing strategies on customers’ perceptions. Moreover, the sentiment analysis shows no heightened negative view after introducing dynamic pricing in restaurants compared to the control group. Contrary to what previous literature suggests, our findings indicate that implementing dynamic pricing does not adversely affect customers’ perceptions or sentiments regarding prices in restaurants. Research limitations/implications: The quasi-experimental setting of the study presents inherent challenges in establishing causality that require further investigation using controlled experimental settings. Nevertheless, our study reveals that restaurant customers do not perceive dynamic pricing as unfair. This finding is critical for restaurant managers when considering the implementation of dynamic pricing and revenue management strategies. In addition, our study highlights the importance of considering not only numerical ratings but customer sentiment analysis as well. This more holistic approach to assessing the impact of pricing strategies can give restaurant managers a deeper understanding of customer reactions. In addition, a more rigorous definition of dynamic pricing is provided, clarifying its nature and its distinction in using different price discrimination. Originality/value: This study contributes to the evolving understanding of dynamic pricing strategies’ impact on customers’ perceptions and sentiments in the restaurant industry. It aims to fill the gap in understanding customer reactions to algorithmically determined prices (via revenue management systems such as DynamEat) in this industry. The combination of causal inference and sentiment analysis offers a novel perspective, shedding light on the nuanced connections between dynamic pricing implementation and customers’ emotions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In today's digital age, customer feedback, particularly gathered from various sources like mobile application reviews, has emerged as a critical resource for service-providing organizations to gain valuable insights into their customers' experiences. As the key objective of service-providing organizations is to facilitate their customers with better services, customer feedback or opinion is a vital resource for such organizations to improve and enhance their services for the betterment of their customers. Explicitly mentioned opinions have been widely studied in research, while a significant gap exists in addressing implicitly described views. Furthermore, most existing research focuses on product-oriented corpora, emphasizing specific product aspects and features. This article presents a novel study on performing end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) by extracting implicit opinion terms, categorizing them, and assigning polarity to each term from mobile app reviews in English. Through this study, we developed a domain-specific, service-oriented, and aspect-based annotated dataset and introduced a novel two-step hybrid approach. The first step involves extracting multiple opinion terms using a rule-based approach. The second step employs machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify the extracted opinion terms into general aspect categories. This two-step approach effectively addresses the double-implicit problem commonly encountered in the previous work on implicit aspects and opinion mining. In addition to traditional machine learning and deep learning models, we fine-tuned BERT to carry out the ABSA task. This approach utilized a pipeline method, where each task's output serves as the subsequent task's input, ensuring a seamless flow of information and improved performance. This multi-step pipeline begins with the extracted opinion terms classification into aspect categories and ends with the assignment of sentiment polarity. Experiments with a hold-out test set for the first step (opinion term extraction using a rule-based approach) achieved an accuracy and precision score of 81.4% and an F1 score of 0.99 %, outperforming several baselines. Further experiments with a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for classifying extracted opinion terms into general aspect categories yielded accuracy scores ranging from 0.68% to 0.74 % and F1 scores ranging from 0.23% to 0.28%. Experiments on sentiment classification using various machine learning algorithms showed accuracy ranges from 0.58% to 0.68% and F1 scores from 0.47% to 0.49%. This two-step approach for implicit opinion term, aspect extraction, and classification outperforms many baseline systems. By leveraging BERT's contextual understanding and fine-tuning it for our specific domain, we significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of our aspect-based sentiment analysis. This approach effectively captured both explicit and implicit opinions from mobile app reviews. Specifically, our method achieved an accuracy of 0.80% and an F1 score of 0.78% for aspect categorization, and an accuracy of 0.79% and an F1 score of 0.70% for sentiment classification, demonstrating substantial improvements over traditional methods.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Among these difficulties are the several dialects spoken in the Maghrebi area and the peculiar grammatical systems. We introduce a complete framework that uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-mini and BERT-base models, improved with large data processing capabilities offered by Apache Spark, to improve scalability and performance. Selecting a variety of datasets, sophisticated preprocessing methods like tokenization, normalization, and keeping special characters and emojis are used, and several model architectures are carefully explored. Our method works; BERT-mini reaches accuracy rates of up to 0.885 and BERT-base reaches 0.899. Conventional machine learning techniques are much outperformed by these outcomes. This paper shows how well BERT models may be integrated with big data technology and points up areas that need more investigation. Our framework offers important insights and useful applications in many domains, including social media monitoring, market analysis, and customer feedback evaluation.

However, achieving robust sentiment analysis across diverse domains remains a significant challenge due to variations in language use, context, and domain-specific vocabulary. This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing sentiment analysis through the synergistic application of domain adaptation and ensemble learning techniques, incorporating both homogeneous and heterogeneous bootstrapping. We leverage state-of-the-art pretrained language models, fine-tuning them on specific domains to improve their sensitivity to domain-specific nuances. Our methodology includes comprehensive strategies for selecting and preprocessing data to facilitate effective domain adaptation. To further enhance model performance and robustness, we employ both homogeneous bootstrapping (using the same model architecture with different initializations) and heterogeneous bootstrapping (using diverse model architectures) as part of our ensemble learning framework. This dual approach allows us to capture a wide range of patterns and interactions within the data. The findings underscore the potential of combining domain adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous bootstrapping techniques to address the inherent challenges of sentiment analysis in diverse and dynamic environments. © 2024, Collegium Basilea.

	abstract = {In recent decades, abstractive text summarization using multimodal input has attracted many researchers due to the capability of gathering information from various sources to create a concise summary. However, the existing methodologies based on multimodal summarization provide only a summary for the short videos and poor results for the lengthy videos. To address the aforementioned issues, this research presented the Multimodal Abstractive Summarization using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (MAS-BERT) with an attention mechanism. The purpose of the video summarization is to increase the speed of searching for a large collection of videos so that the users can quickly decide whether the video is relevant or not by reading the summary. Initially, the data is obtained from the publicly available How2 dataset and is encoded using the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) encoder and the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) encoder. The textual data which is embedded in the embedding layer is encoded using a bidirectional GRU encoder and the features with audio and video data are encoded with LSTM encoder. After this, BERT based attention mechanism is used to combine the modalities and finally, the BI-GRU based decoder is used for summarizing the multimodalities. The results obtained through the experiments that show the proposed MAS-BERT has achieved a better result of 60.2 for Rouge-1 whereas, the existing Decoder-only Multimodal Transformer (D-MmT) and the Factorized Multimodal Transformer based Decoder Only Language model (FLORAL) has achieved 49.58 and 56.89 respectively. Our work facilitates users by providing better contextual information and user experience and would help video-sharing platforms for customer retention by allowing users to search for relevant videos by looking at its summary. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have significantly empowered the safety and operational efficiency within the aviation sector for safer and more efficient operations. Airlines derive informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning through extensive contextual analysis of customer reviews and feedback from social media, such as Twitter and Facebook. However, this form of analytical endeavor is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Extensive studies have investigated NLP algorithms for sentiment analysis based on textual customer feedback, thereby underscoring the necessity for an in-depth investigation of transformer architecture-based NLP models. In this study, we conducted an exploration of the large language model BERT and three of its derivatives using an airline sentiment tweet dataset for downstream tasks. We further honed this fine-tuning by adjusting the hyperparameters, thus improving the model’s consistency and precision of outcomes. With RoBERTa distinctly emerging as the most precise and overall effective model in both the binary (96.97%) and tri-class (86.89%) sentiment classification tasks and persisting in outperforming others in the balanced dataset for tri-class sentiment classification, our results validate the BERT models’ application in analyzing airline industry customer sentiment. In addition, this study identifies the scope for improvement in future studies, such as investigating more systematic and balanced datasets, applying other large language models, and using novel fine-tuning approaches. Our study serves as a pivotal benchmark for future exploration in customer sentiment analysis, with implications that extend from the airline industry to broader transportation sectors, where customer feedback plays a crucial role. © 2023 by the authors.},

Consequently, conducting comparative analyses of such sources has become the de facto modus operandi of any business that wishes to give itself a competitive edge over its peers and improve customer loyalty. Sentiment analysis is one such method instrumental in gauging public interest, exposing market trends, and analysing competitors. While traditional sentiment analysis focuses on overall sentiment, as the needs advance with time, it has become important to explore public opinions and sentiments on various specific subjects, products and services mentioned in the reviews on a finer-granular level. To this end, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), supported by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which have contributed to a paradigm shift from simple word-level analysis to tone and context-aware analyses, focuses on identifying specific aspects within the text and determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. In this study, we compare several deep-NN methods for ABSA on two benchmark datasets (Restaurant-14 and Laptop-14) and found that FAST LSA obtains the best overall results of 87.6% and 82.6% accuracy but does not pass LSA+DeBERTa which reports 90.33% and 86.21% accuracy respectively. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The abundance of publicly available data on the internet within the e-marketing domain is consistently expanding. A significant portion of this data revolve around consumers’ perceptions and opinions regarding the goods or services of organizations, making it valuable for market intelligence collectors in marketing, customer relationship management, and customer retention. Sentiment analysis serves as a tool for examining customer sentiment, marketing initiatives, and product appraisals. This valuable information can inform decisions related to future product and service development, marketing campaigns, and customer service enhancements. In social media, predicting ratings is commonly employed to anticipate product ratings based on user reviews. Our study provides an extensive benchmark comparison of different deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). These models are evaluated using various word embedding techniques, such as bi-directional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and its derivatives, FastText, and Word2Vec. The evaluation encompasses two setups: 5-class versus 3-class. This paper focuses on sentiment analysis using neural network-based models for consumer sentiment prediction by evaluating and contrasting their performance indicators on a dataset of reviews of different products from customers of an online women’s clothes retailer. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique to determine the various sentiments of a customer in a single comment regarding different aspects. The increasing online data content generated by interested customers and reviewers motivated researchers and data scientists to conduct ABSA. ABSA has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its versatility in e-commerce, social media, and customer feedback analysis. However, ABSA faces several significant challenges, including determining the aspects and their sentiment polarities (positive, negative, or neutral) in a given text. Moreover, ABSA faces particular challenges in non-English languages such as Arabic due to the lack of resources and mature models. Typically, ABSA tackles one or more of the ABSA research tasks: (T1) aspect term extraction, (T2) aspect term polarity, (T3) aspect category identification, and (T4) aspect category polarity. To identify the aspects and their corresponding sentiment polarities in a given text, accurate and efficient NLP techniques are required. Despite growing interest in Arabic ABSA, the lack of annotated datasets and pre-trained models has hindered its development. In this research, we have collected a dataset of Arabic game reviews and annotated them using three annotators, and then we trained an ABSA deep learning model based on the BERT pre-trained model combined with zero-shot learning (ZSL) to tackle all the four aforementioned tasks. Our best performing model achieved a high accuracy on all four tasks with an accuracy of 91.61% on T1, 90.99% on T2, 79.08% on T3, and 88.17% on T4. Finally, we compared our model’s accuracy with the state-of-the-art Arabic-based ABSA models on different datasets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.},

	abstract = {The current investigation addresses the possibilities and limitations of the sentiment analysis of consumer remarks in the context of economic needs. It makes it easier for businesses to comprehend how the public's opinion shapes their abilities to satisfy clientele. Sentiment analysis concerns the assessment and interpretation of various forms of evaluation, such as product ratings, reviewer responses, and question-and-answer sessions. Thus, it exposes attitudes, trends and emotions concerning products and services. Commercialization has gained a lot of momentum over the years, and platforms like amazon.com form an important basis for customer feedback for organizations that have a lot of content to analyze. In the context of this research, consumer reviews and Q and A sections are collected through web scraping, and the latter is studied using the BERT neural network. Owing to its sophisticated natural language processing capabilities, BERT renders an accurate analysis of text sentiment as it considers even the slightest variation in the meaning of words. It does not stop at simply tagging the reviews as positive, negative or neutral; rather, it looks for sentiments and related themes that may affect consumers' attitudes and behaviours. In order to complement these findings, confidence intervals are introduced to allow for the handicapping of customer opinion averages and the confidence attached to predicting the Sentiment. This merging of BERT with confidence levels in the BERT predictions helps to clear any grey areas regarding the comments given on the product, thus providing comprehensive coverage of how the product was received and customer satisfaction. The results of the study show that this twofold strategy assists companies in better comprehending customer reviews that, in turn, shape their tactical plans, especially in marketing, product enhancement and customer care activities. This approach reveals customer feelings more explicitly and enables companies to take a proactive stance towards addressing customers' needs, thus enhancing customers' satisfaction and the product's success. © 2025 Vithya Ganesan, Kirubakaran Namaskaram, Viriyala Sri Anima Padmini, Subrata Chowdhury and Hariharan Shanmugasundaram.

As the hospitality industry increasingly relies on online customer feedback to improve services and strategize marketing, accurately analyzing this feedback is crucial. Our research employs a multi-task learning framework to simultaneously conduct sentiment analysis and categorize reviews into aspects such as service quality, ambiance, and food. We assess the capabilities of fine-tuned Transformer models and LLMs with prompt engineering in processing and understanding the complex user-generated content prevalent in the hospitality industry. The results show that fine-tuned models, particularly RoBERTa, are more adept at classification tasks due to their deep contextual processing abilities and faster execution times. In contrast, while ChatGPT and GPT-4 excel in sentiment analysis by better capturing the nuances of human emotions, they require more computational power and longer processing times. Our findings support the hypothesis that fine-tuning models can achieve better results and faster execution than using prompt engineering in LLMs for multi-class classification in hospitality reviews. This study suggests that selecting the appropriate NLP model depends on the task’s specific needs, balancing computational efficiency and the depth of sentiment analysis required for actionable insights in hospitality management. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In an era of unprecedented digital communication and information sharing, understanding the sentiment expressed in textual data is of paramount importance. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing, has gained significant prominence due to its potential to decipher the emotions, opinions, and attitudes conveyed through words. This research paper embarks on a journey into the realm of sentiment analysis, where we explore the nuanced interplay of words and emotions in the digital landscape. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) becomes one of the subjects most learned in the education and literature fields of the present day. Superior research in the field electronics focuses mainly on developed economies. From the e-commerce view, the experience of customers has shifted from visiting retail shops to online shopping, making the analysis of customer behavior more salient. In this dataset, the review is taken into account in this sentiment analysis, considering, executing, and analyzing effective ways. Most probabilistic models are used in current research ventures, in the area of text classification, and information retrieval, among other contexts. In turn, ecommerce has grown much broader with online shopping, which is a core platform through which shoppers may be found. In the same breath, it is very imperative to forecast the level of transactions that will be facilitated through e-commerce. This paper will focus on identifying broad patterns in the written opinions of the consumers by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective of this research is to predict whether customers will recommend the product they purchased by using the information in review text. © 2024 IEEE.},

The evaluation of results enables the firm conviction that BERT can reach the level of 85% accuracy in terms of text classification and 88% in sentiment analysis. It is expected that the model has strong capabilities of both categorizing and understanding the content of the video. Moreover, GPT is particularly effective in text generation and reaches the level of 0.75 BLEU-4 and 0.72 ROUGE-L, which can indicate that the technology is capable of generating content similar to what was created by humans. On top of that, the model reaches a perplexity of 25.6, which means that it can predict outcomes better than most alternative models available on the market. Simultaneously, Word2Vec results in similitude expansion equal to 0.68 cosine similarity score and a striking 72% accuracy level in terms of word analogy tasks. The findings suggest that the model is in a position to understand semantics and enables it to teach it patterns and trending data is then received and presented.

	abstract = {The proliferation of mobile stock trading has introduced various apps with distinct features, emphasizing the need to understand users' evaluations after adopting the service. This study explores the determinants of retail investors’ satisfaction with mobile stock trading services by employing an advanced textual analysis of customer reviews for four leading trading applications. We utilized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based Topic modeling (BERTopic modeling) to identify key topics within customer reviews and used the results as input for generative AI to discern the theme and sentiment of each topic. Based on Service Quality (SERVQUAL) theory, topics are categorized into key quality dimensions: functionality, usability, information quality, customer service, and system quality. Regression models were employed to assess the impact of the quality dimensions on investor satisfaction, revealing positive feedback on usability, information quality, and service quality as primary enhancers of satisfaction. In contrast, negative feedback on service quality, system quality, and functionality was identified as the primary inhibitor of satisfaction. This study explores how the influence of each quality dimension varies among different types of brokers (full-service vs. online-only brokerages). Finally, we propose a visualization tool called Topic Rating Impact and Frequency Analysis (TRIFA), which is designed to categorize topics based on their frequency of occurrence and impact on satisfaction. This tool aids in identifying the strengths and areas for improvement in services by effectively visualizing the results of text review analysis. This research not only deepens our understanding of the quality dimensions of mobile financial services but also offers valuable insights for service providers by suggesting predictive models that could help increase customer retention. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study introduces an innovative approach to sentiment analysis, specifically tailored for the Arabic language, a domain that poses unique challenges due to its complex morphology and diverse dialects. Utilizing a substantial dataset of over 108,000 reviews related to Arabic companies, our primary objective was to develop a robust and reliable sentiment scoring system that caters to the intricacies of the Arabic language, aimed at assisting businesses in understanding customer sentiments more effectively.Our methodology encompassed an extensive preprocessing phase, crucial for preparing the dataset for accurate analysis. This phase included converting emojis and emoticons into textual descriptions a contemporary and expressive facet of digital communication, removing Arabic diacritics to standardize text input, and normalizing the text for consistency. The preprocessing was carefully designed to address the specific challenges posed by the Arabic script and dialectal variations.For the core sentiment analysis, we employed two robust machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Each model was meticulously chosen and adapted for its proven effectiveness in text classification, especially in handling the nuances of sentiment analysis within the Arabic text. Our approach not only leverages the strengths of these models but also adapts them to accommodate the linguistic characteristics of Arabic.The results of our study provide significant contributions to the field of sentiment analysis in Arabic. By addressing the unique challenges of the language and adapting conventional machine learning techniques accordingly, our research offers valuable insights and tools for businesses and researchers focused on the Arab market. These insights are instrumental for companies seeking to understand and respond to customer sentiments in a linguistically diverse and culturally rich region. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Restaurant owners need to understand and react to customer feedback to remain competitive in the long term. Customers provide essential feedback electronically via online platforms such as Google Maps. To better understand customer feedback, we developed a multi-label text classifier to classify feedback into categories of aspects customers criticize and comment on. Since restaurants, like many small and medium-sized enterprises, do not have the resources to maintain computationally intensive deep learning architectures, we present a simple knowledge distillation approach in this paper. On the test dataset, our approach performs better than a BERT model at a much smaller model size and with significantly better inference time.

The research involves the development of an ensemble model, integrating random forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), selected from a thorough evaluation of 10 machine learning models. The objective is to streamline the classification of customer emails into predefined categories-specifically, "replacements and refunds issues", "account related issues", and "others". The methodology involves the extraction and manual labelling of approximately 2000 emails that were obtained after web scraping. The email bot incorporates an algorithm to determine urgency levels based on factors such as product cost, complaint history, product importance, customer sentiment, and keyword analysis. Integrated with the Gmail API, the bot efficiently tags and escalates incoming emails to the relevant department. Performance metrics, including total resolution time and write cycles, gauge the success of the implemented solution. Results indicate a significant reduction in the time and effort required for complaint resolution, thereby enhancing overall customer experience.

	abstract = {In the ever-changing world of business, gaining valuable insights from customer perspectives is crucial. Consumer evaluations are crucial performance indicators for businesses seeking to enhance their impact. Cyberspace is expanding with an increasing volume of reviews, making it challenging to extract relevant information for desired products. This research explores sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews in the domain of communication technology, utilizing four publicly available datasets. Sentiment analysis is frequently employed to support E-Commerce platforms in monitoring customer feedback on their products and striving to understand customer needs and preferences. Acknowledging that solely relying on user reviews is insufficient to achieve the best performance, we enhance our approach by incorporating additional context from product titles and headlines for a more comprehensive understanding of the learning algorithm. This paper utilizes three distinct embedding methods, including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and FastText. FastText outperformed other embeddings when stacked with XGBoost and CatBoost, resulting in the FastXCatStack model. This model achieved accuracy scores of 0.93, 0.93, and 0.94 on mobile electronics, major appliances, and personal care appliances datasets respectively, and linear SVM showed an accuracy score of 0.91 on software reviews when combined with FastText. This research study also provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning-based models, including approaches like LSTM, GRU, and convolutional neural networks as well as transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET. In the concluding phase, interpretability modeling was applied using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to gain deeper insights into the model’s decision-making process. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Most research in sentiment analysis, as well as aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), classifies sentiment polarity into two classes (positive and negative) or three classes (positive, negative, and neutral), excluding conflict sentiment. A sentiment will be classified as conflict if it expresses both positive and negative sentiments. Ignoring conflict sentiment will cause the classification to be less accurate. This study investigates the four-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral, and including conflict) and proposes a model utilizing a pretrained language representation model (BERT) for identifying conflict sentiment in ABSA. We also employ an open-source large language model (LLM) created by Meta, Llama 3, for generating synthetic data to support research on four-class sentiment classification in ABSA. Background Public opinions and experiences on product reviews, social events, political movements, etc., can be used for exploring customer behavior, predicting customer preferences, understanding public sentiment, etc., so it becomes an important component in the decision-making process. Providing an accurate opinion will enable an individual, business, or organization to have an informed judgement before making a decision. An aspect-based sentiment analysis, utilizing a four-class sentiment classification system - comprising positive, negative, neutral, and conflict - will produce a more precise assessment than a general sentiment analysis utilizing a two- or three-class sentiment classification system. Methodology This study utilizes a methodology that includes generating synthetic data to augment the original datasets, designing the input representation, detecting aspect categories, performing a multi-label sentiment classification, and representing sentiment in a four-class sentiment classification. Contribution This study provides an investigation of the four-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral, and conflict) and proposes a BERT-based method to identify aspects with conflict sentiment in ABSA. Moreover, it also evaluates Llama 3 for generating synthetic data to address the issues related to data scarcity and imbalanced datasets in the research on four-class sentiment classification in ABSA. The validation of the proposed model on the SemEval-2014 restaurant domain dataset shows an improvement in conflict sentiment accuracy compared to baselines. Findings The investigation of the four-class sentiment classification task in ABSA demonstrates that identifying conflict sentiment is challenging for several reasons. Among them are (1) the lack of a public dataset for this research; (2) the small amount of data with conflict labels in the available dataset resulting in an imbalanced dataset; (3) conflict sentiment is a complex sentiment containing both positive and negative sentiments; and (4) conflict sentiments are usually expressed in long and complicated sentences and involve implicit aspects. Our solution to these challenges involved generating synthetic data using Llama 3 and designing a BERT-based model on multi-label aspects for identifying aspect with conflict sentiment. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous methods in identifying the fourth sentiment in four-class sentiment classification, i.e., aspects with conflict sentiment. Recommendations Most existing ABSA models with four-class sentiment classification are con-for Practitioners ducted for product reviews (mostly in the restaurant domain) and in high-resource languages (mainly in English). Therefore, users may need to make some adjustments to different domains and languages. Recommendations Due to the limited availability of datasets for research in aspect-based sentiment for Researchers analysis with four-class sentiment classification, it is important to urgently develop extra supporting datasets. Impact on Society Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which employs a four-class sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral, and conflict), provides a comprehensive analysis about the aspects (or target of opinion) and their sentiment. It will help us understand the sentiment analysis problem better. By providing more accurate sentiment through aspect-based sentiment analysis with four-class sentiment classification, this study can better assist individuals, organizations, or companies in gaining a view or an opinion about any product, service, or candidate in an electoral vote. Future Research Future research on aspect-based sentiment analysis could evaluate other open-source large language models (LLMs), such as Gemma, Mixtral, etc., for generating synthetic data and evaluating the model across various domains and languages. Furthermore, future research could also utilize the LLMs to perform ABSA tasks, such as aspect term extraction, aspect category detection, and sentiment polarities, through fine-tuning the LLMs. © 2025 Informing Science Institute.

	abstract = {Sentiment Analysis has emerged as a pivotal technique for understanding user opinions and sentiments expressed in textual data. In the context of e-commerce websites, where vast amounts of user-generated content are generated daily, leveraging the power of Transfer Learning becomes crucial for building effective sentiment analysis models. This research focuses on the application of Transfer Learning techniques in the domain of e-commerce sentiment analysis, utilizing pretrained transformer-based models. Aspect-based sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a crucial natural language processing task that involves analyzing sentiment expressions toward specific aspects or features within a given text. This paper presents an approach to ABSA utilizing transformer-based deep learning models. Specifically, we leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides access to state-of-the-art pretrained models. Our method employs the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a powerful transformer architecture, for sentiment classification. This research contributes to the growing field of sentiment analysis by providing a robust and scalable approach to ABSA using transformer-based learning. The combination of transformer architectures and pretrained models demonstrates the capability to capture intricate sentiment nuances, making the proposed method a valuable asset for applications in customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and other domains where aspect-level sentiment understanding is crucial. The application of transfer learning in sentiment analysis for e-commerce not only contributes to advancing the field of natural language processing but also provides practical solutions for businesses seeking to harness the wealth of customer sentiment embedded in textual data on their online platforms. © 2024 IEEE.},

However, with the advent of multimodality, travel reviews have brought new challenges. Early methods for detecting such reviews merely combined text and image features, resulting in poor feature correlation. To address this issue, our study proposes a novel multimodal tourism review sentiment analysis method enhanced by relevant features. Initially, we employ a fusion model that combines BERT and Text-CNN for text feature extraction. This approach strengthens semantic relationships and filters noise effectively. Subsequently, we utilize ResNet-51 for image feature extraction, leveraging its ability to learn complex visual representations. Additionally, integrating an attention mechanism further enhances modality correlation, thereby improving fusion effectiveness. On the Multi-ZOL dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 90.7% and an F1 score of 90.8%. Similarly, on the Ctrip dataset, it attains an accuracy of 83.6% and an F1 score of 84.1%. © 2024 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

From financial markets to supply chain management, logistics, and technology legitimacy assessment, sentiment analysis offers insights into public sentiment, actionable data, and improved decision forecasting. This study contributes to this growing body of research by offering a novel multi-view deep learning approach to sentiment analysis that incorporates non-textual features like emojis. The proposed approach considers both textual and emoji views as distinct views of emotional information for the sentiment classification model, and the results acknowledge their individual and combined contributions to sentiment analysis. Comparative analysis with baseline classifiers reveals that incorporating emoji features significantly enriches sentiment analysis, enhancing the accuracy, F1-score, and execution time of the proposed model. Additionally, this study employs LIME for explainable sentiment analysis to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enabling high-stakes businesses to understand the factors driving customer sentiment. The present study contributes to the literature on multi-view text classification in the context of social media and provides an innovative analytics method for businesses to extract valuable emotional information from electronic word of mouth (eWOM), which can help them stay ahead of the competition in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

	abstract = {Online product reviews provide valuable insights into customer sentiment toward products; however, they often contain multiple sentences with redundant and non-essential content, making it harder to extract critical information. Identifying key sentences that directly impact sentiment along with fine-grained feature extraction is essential for reliable multi-class sentiment classification with greater explainability. Existing studies on document-level sentiment analysis with sentence-wise learning often overlook important local feature extraction at both the sentence and document levels for multi-class sentiment classification, limiting the selection of key sentences with greater transparency. These models rely on sequential processing of text rather than parallel processing, which can lead to missed important fine-grained features and long-range dependencies spread across sentences. Additionally, sequential models place more emphasis on the latter part of the text, assuming that the emotional aspects are concentrated at the end of the review. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based dilated sentence attention deep learning model (Bert_DSENT_Att) for important fine-grained local feature extraction by capturing long-range dependencies within sentences, thereby enabling the selection of key sentences that directly impact multi-class sentiment classification. First, the BERT pre-trained language model captures global features through a feature vector representation. Next, a multi-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with varying kernels and dilation rates extracts long range local features at the sentence level. We employ within-sentence attention and between-sentence attention to extract important fine-grained features from the hierarchical representation. The experimental results show that our model outperforms seven baselines across three datasets in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure. A thorough ablation study demonstrated the contribution of each component to overall performance. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis has numerous applications across various domains such as Social Media Monitoring, Customer Feedback Analysis, Market Research, Financial Markets, Product Reviews, Political Analysis, Employee Feedback, Healthcare, Tourism, and Education. Industries use sentiment analysis to develop informing policy and product design for wider acceptance and improved revenue. Classification methods, from keyword distribution to advanced models like Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers, have been employed to categorize sentiments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral. Transformer-based models like OpenAI’s chatGPT (a chatbot using Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)-based Large Language Model) and Google’s BARD (a chatbot based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework) struggle with local context and bias issues. In this paper, we combine Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), GPT and BERT features to predict the sentiments, addressing local context to enhance the model.

	abstract = {Social media platforms play a significant role in analyzing customer perceptions of financial products and services in today's culture. These platforms facilitate the immediate and in-depth sharing of thoughts and experiences, offering valuable insights into consumer behaviour. Any customer looking for such a service would surf the internet for reviews and ratings before making a decision, which usually influences their ultimate pick. Feedback and suggestions from friends, family, and coworkers improve customer experiences. Customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping the reputation and profitability of businesses and products offered by financial institutions, often serving as the final assessment of quality and satisfaction during decision-making. Therefore, it is paramount for decision-makers to carefully evaluate customer feedback and understand the sentiment expressed in a given piece of text, which could lead to equity trading, and credit market assessment, and offer invaluable insights that boost the financial performance of the institution. Previous research has used human-annotated text, such as lexicon-based methods, to train machine learning models for sentiment analysis, but the approach did not capture the full range of structure and semantic relationships in natural language. Therefore, our research aims to develop a more comprehensive and accurate sentiment analysis model using advanced natural language processing techniques that could answer questions on various subjects and tasks. To do this, we first crawled customer reviews on Hellopeter, a popular review site, and financial data on the top five financial institutions listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa. After that, we used OpenAI's ChatGPT as a zero-short learning model to generate human-like annotation tools for different sentiment tasks. The OpenAI ChatGPT feature vector was subsequently fed into BERT, BiLSTM, and a SoftMax function to detect and identify the sentiment of a given sentence. Lastly, we use feature vectors with oversampling methods to address the imbalanced data dilemma and visualise the contribution features of the given piece of text for the customer reviewers. The experiments demonstrated that the method performed as well as or better than the latest and most effective methods on the tested datasets, yielding comparable results. When OpenAI's ChatGPT was combined with pre-trained BERT and BiLSTM models, it did better overall, with an average score of 98.9%, an F1-measure of 97.7%, and an AUC of 91.90% when oversampling was used. The traditional lexicon-based model got an 86.68% score using SVM and logistic regression and an AUC of 91.90%. The study shows the exceptional performance of OpenAI ChatGPT in detecting the emotional tone or polarity of a given sentence in a customer review, which helps with annotation and understanding the sentiment analysis of an event and how it influences decisions and outcomes. In conclusion, these results underscore the significant advantages of incorporating customer sentiment analysis into financial analysis and decision-making processes as a valuable tool for understanding and prioritizing customer needs and preferences.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This study aims to enhance customer satisfaction through sentiment analysis utilizing machine learning techniques, with additional case studies conducted to ensure comprehensive method validation. Traditional sentiment analysis methods frequently fail to manage the complexity and volume of feedback data, yielding to less accurate insights. To address this challenge, we analyzed six machine learning models: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest, AdaBoost, and BERT, with a particular focus on BERT. Our results demonstrate that BERT outperformed the other models in terms of both accuracy and processing speed, achieving an accuracy of up to 95%. The excellence of BERT in managing large and complex datasets provides a more precise sentiment analysis, which can significantly improve service quality and customer loyalty, while increasing company revenue by up to 15%.

	abstract = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is essential in industries such as healthcare, automotive, and finance, where understanding customer feedback is crucial for business strategies and product development. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often fail to account for specific aspects, providing only generalized sentiment scores (polarities). This study aims to develop a robust ABSA architecture to accurately classify aspect-based sentiment polarity. We propose a Modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (M-LDA) model that integrates Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract relevant aspects. Additionally, an Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (O-BERT) model is used to determine aspect-based sentiment polarity, categorizing sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is then employed to enhance classification accuracy. The M-LDA O-BERTLSTM for ABSA (MOL-ABSA) performance, evaluated using accuracy and macro-F-score metrics on the SemEval 2014 and a generalized dataset, demonstrates its effectiveness, achieving accuracies of 81.19%, 85.26%, and 87.53%, respectively. This integrated approach combines traditional NLP techniques with advanced machine learning models to ensure high accuracy. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society). All rights reserved.},

This process holds immense significance across industries, including mental health, customer sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction. This abstract encompasses the essence of emotion detection, its vital role in understanding human behaviors and sentiments, and the diverse methods employed. The research explores three distinct emotion detection techniques: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach (ROBERTA), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These methods are evaluated for their effectiveness in recognizing emotions, from subtle nuances to overt expressions. The results reveal ROBERTA's exceptional prowess, consistently outperforming its counterparts across various emotional categories. Particularly remarkable is its ability to predict the emotion "gratitude," with an impressive F1-score of 0.8458, underscoring its potential in capturing complex emotional states. This research emphasizes the significance of emotion detection in bridging human-computer interaction gaps and enabling a more nuanced understanding of user sentiments. The findings emphasize the prominence of ROBERTA as a powerful tool in emotion detection, offering insights into its capacity to comprehend diverse human emotions effectively. © 2024, Penerbit UTHM.

	abstract = {In the mobile game industry, modelling customer requirements (CRs) is becoming indispensable for developers before improving games. Online reviews, as a common way of customer feedback, can reflect customers’ real experiences and preferences. Several studies have extracted important CRs from online reviews of mobile games, but they have not thoroughly analysed the correlation with customer satisfaction. In this study, we propose a CR modelling framework to extract and classify CRs from online reviews and analyse the influence of each CR on customer satisfaction to assist developers in improving games. First, we extract important CRs based on word embedding from online reviews. Then, we construct a BERT-Word2Vec-Convolutional Neural Network (BW-CNN) model to analyse the sentiment of online reviews by considering semantic features at Chinese character and word granularity. Finally, based on the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) method, the S-Kano model is further proposed to classify the CRs considering customer attention, and the product improvement suggestions are provided for the corresponding mobile game developers based on the CR classification results. To verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, we crawled the online reviews of four Gacha games from taptap (www.taptap.cn) for case study and compared with the existing methods. The results show that our proposed framework is effective in modelling CRs from online reviews of mobile games. Meanwhile, the results comparison illustrate that customer attention has a significant influence on the CRs classification. In addition, we find that the S-Kano categories of CRs vary across games, and there is strong heterogeneity among games. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Natural Language Processing (NLP)-driven applied linguistics for sarcasm detection includes computational models to understand and identify sarcastic expressions within text. This interdisciplinary method integrates linguistics principles with advanced NLP techniques to identify subtle and nuanced cues indicative of sarcasm correctly. It includes computational approaches like linguistic feature extraction, machine learning models, and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) algorithms, including transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), hold significant potential in capturing complex linguistic nuances inherent in sarcastic expression. These approaches can learn the hierarchical representation of text, which enables capturing context dependency, which is crucial for accurately detecting sarcasm. The applications of NLP-driven applied linguistics for sarcasm detection show great potential in various domains namely social media analysis, online content moderation, and customer feedback interpretation. By automating sarcasm detection, this system can enhance communication understanding, improve sentiment analysis accuracy, and contribute to better decision-making processes in various contexts. This study develops automated Sarcasm Detection using the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm with Deep Learning (ASD-AHADL) technique. The ASD-AHADL technique applies the optimal DL model for detecting sarcastic content. To achieve this, the ASD-AHADL technique undergoes data preprocessing and the BERT-based word embedding process at the initial stage. Followed by the ASD-AHADL technique uses attention-gated recurrent unit long short-term memory (AGRU-LSTM) for the sarcasm detection process. At last, the AHA-based parameter tuning process is involved to fine-tune the parameters based on the DL algorithm. The experimental study of the ASD-AHADL technique has been tested under a social media dataset. The outcomes indicated that the solution of the ASD-AHADL technique was significant compared to others. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.},

It is observed that in many of the cases, emojis and emoticons are found to convey a lot of significant information about the user’s opinion or experience regarding a certain product, a service or an event. Consequently, it is very much essential that these emojis/emoticons are considered for processing because they are found to play a vital role in sentiment expression, often conveying more explicit information than the text alone. Their inclusion helps in capturing nuanced sentiments, improving the overall accuracy of sentiment classification. In Spite of the fact that these elements are a significant part of the review comment provided by the customer, it is a common practice among the contemporary researchers to eliminate them right at the data-cleaning or the preprocessing stage. With an objective to provide a solution to the above drawback, we present a novel approach that performs sentiment analysis, with effective utilization of emojis and emoticons, upon the US Airline tweet dataset using various Machine Learning classifiers and the BERT model.

	abstract = {This study introduces an innovative system designed to predict customer satisfaction scores through the integration of sentiment analysis of customer feedback alongside all related factors from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The system implements the latest transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa then assess customer sentiment using an ensemble learning voting mechanism for accurate sentiment classification, and adaptive customer satisfaction rating. The model generates baseline scores dynamically, based on factors like customer loyalty, and frequency of interactions with the firm, thus enhancing accuracy and relevance when assessing satisfaction. The system is also developed to utilize Turkish data optimizing usage in market shares for firms serving that user group. Empirical results indicate that the ensemble learning approach significantly improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis and the reliability of satisfaction quantification. This resource provides additional contribution to the CRM literature by providing a credible and scalable mechanism to assess customer satisfaction to potentially be implemented in practice across industries. Future work will focus on extending the system's scalability and enhancing its predictive capabilities across diverse sectors. © 2024 IEEE.},

We extend beyond typical sentiment analysis by focusing on specific aspects of products such as features and qualities to provide a comprehensive analysis. Our methodology involves rigorous data preprocessing, including stemming, stop words removal, lemmatization, lower casing, contraction expansion, and tokenization, ensuring organized text data for efficient and accurate analysis. Central to our approach is the Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) step, which employs techniques such as POS Tagging, Noun Combination, Dependency Parsing, and Stop Word Removal to extract aspects from the text. These customized rules identify linguistic patterns and grammatical structures, revealing detailed facets of products. We fine-tune a BERT model for ABSA, processing the dataset to classify aspect sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative, and assigning a sentiment score ranging from –1 (extreme negativity) to +1 (extreme positivity). By leveraging advanced machine learning, we enhance the accuracy and depth of sentiment analysis, providing detailed insights into customer sentiments.

	abstract = {Analyzing sentiment in hotel reviews is important for effective disaster management. Understanding and categorizing guests' opinions and emotions about their hotel experiences can help identify potential issues promptly and enable hotels to respond to concerns, especially during crises such as natural disasters, health emergencies, or other disruptive events. Implicit sentiment analysis, an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves analyzing sentiments not explicitly stated in text documents, such as hotel comments. This form of sentiment analysis considers the broader context, tone, and linguistic cues present in the text to uncover underlying attitudes and feelings. By analyzing sentiment in guest reviews, hotels can better prepare for and mitigate the impact of disasters by addressing common concerns and improving overall service quality. To explore the application of sentiment analysis techniques and extract valuable insights from customer feedback, we used two datasets: A and B. We collected reviews from Algerian hotels in dataset A. Dataset B contains 38,932 reviews from hotels and restaurants from websites such as Booking and TripAdvisor. Because of the limited size of dataset A, we applied only machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy with 90.9%. Additionally, we compared different frameworks, including machine learning, deep learning, and transformer models, using dataset B. The results show that the Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) model outperformed other approaches, yielding an accuracy of 93.76%.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {User feedback in text classification serves multiple purposes, including refining models, enhancing datasets, adapting to user preferences, identifying emerging topics, and evaluating system performance, all of which contribute to the creation of more effective and user-centric classification systems. Many text classification techniques, including data mining, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, have been employed in previous literature, each making significant contributions to the field. This paper aims to contribute by guiding researchers seeking commonly used classification techniques and evaluation metrics in text processing. Additionally, it identifies the classification technique that generates higher accuracy and works as a basis for researchers to synthesize studies within their respective fields. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) methodology is adapted to systematically review 28 current literatures on text classification on user feedback. The results obtained are guided by four research questions; paper distribution year, dataset source and size; evaluation metric and model accuracy. The review has shown that support vector machines (SVM) are frequently employed and consistently achieve high levels of accuracy as high as 97.17% with various datasets used.

	abstract = {The airline industry has suffered a severe impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It resulted in significant financial losses. Strategic route planning is now an urgent need to mitigate the ongoing crisis. Motivated by the importance of customer sentiment in informing airline route decisions, this paper presents EAGLE (Enhancing Airline Groundtruth Labels and rEview rating prediction), a novel two-stage framework that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the limitations of current works, which often rely on manual labeling and traditional machine learning models. In the first phase, EAGLE introduces a pseudo-labeling approach using LLMs to automatically label customer reviews to reduce the need for manual annotation and mitigate potential biases that exist in human labeling. The second phase employs a zero-shot LLM-based text classification method to predict customer sentiment and preferences from online reviews to provide a more accurate and context-aware analysis of customer feedback. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of EAGLE to demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques. The proposed framework empowers airline companies to make data-driven decisions about route expansions, considering customer preferences and sentiments. Our contribution fibs in enhancing the objectivity of sentiment analysis and providing a comprehensive and scalable solution for airline route planning in the post-pandemic era, eventually leading to improved customer satisfaction and optimized operations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {Social commerce uses a variety of social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and business Whatsapp as a platform to promote products and services. Since advertising, a product, or service in s-comm will reach as high as a possible number of users on networking sites. Ads will spread virally by sharing among friends and friends of friends. So that wider reachability is possible and shortly will get the customer for our business. The success of an s-comm campaign is measured by the degree to which consumers interact with the sellers through review comments, likes, and shares between friends. Customer behavior analysis is needed for s-comm marketing because social commerce can significantly boost economic growth. The sentiment analysis of customer recommendations was investigated using a dataset of women's s-comm apparel hashtags and reviews. So for such reviews are experimented with different machine learning algorithms (Decision tree, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Naïve Bayes and LSTM). These models handled the common English reviews and compared the metrics (Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity) with one another. Instead of working with individual model, this paper introduces a novel hybrid approach that integrates CNN and Ada Boost LSTM algorithms to provide better results in sentiment analysis when compared to other machine learning algorithms mentioned above. While considering the hash tag with common review comments the hybrid system is out performed. The comparison analysis is done for performance matrices namely accuracy of 98%, specificity of 98.1%, and sensitivity of 98.1%. In the s-commerce transaction industry, this hybrid approach will help to create a deeper understanding of consumer sentiment analysis and psychologically attract clients. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a vital component of natural language processing (NLP), enabling the classification of text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It is widely used in customer feedback analysis and social media monitoring but faces a significant challenge: bias. Biases, often introduced through imbalanced training datasets, can distort model predictions and result in unfair outcomes. To address this, we propose a bias-aware sentiment analysis framework leveraging Bias-BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a customized classifier designed to balance accuracy and fairness. Our approach begins with adapting the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification dataset by converting toxicity scores into sentiment labels, making it suitable for sentiment analysis. This process includes data preparation steps like cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, all aimed at reducing bias. At the heart of our method is a novel loss function incorporating a bias-aware term based on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. This term guides the model toward fair predictions by penalizing biased outputs while maintaining robust classification performance. Ethical considerations are integral to our framework, ensuring the responsible deployment of AI models. This methodology highlights a pathway to equitable sentiment analysis by actively mitigating dataset biases and promoting fairness in NLP applications. © 2024 by the authors.},

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is a statutory board that oversees the food safety and security of Singapore. Part of its functions is to monitor and detect potential food-borne incidents. Currently, SFA scientists rely on manual efforts to gather relevant information from various internal datasets for risk assessments and decision making. This is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human errors. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a system called SFA-FSM, which applies advanced AI technologies for predictive food safety risk monitoring. In particular, we fine-tune Transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BERT and XLNet into SFA-FSM for online food safety news monitoring, customer feedback monitoring, and named entity extraction. Moreover, we have conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed food safety monitoring approaches. The experimental results have shown that the proposed approaches have achieved promising performance. © 2023 IEEE.},

The latest trends show that customers are more comfortable using social media and chat services as feedback delivery media compared to sending emails. In this study, we classify user feedback from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Indonesia named IndiHome. In this study, there are two test scenarios carried out to classify, the first scenario uses Short Term Memory combined with Word Embedding, and the second scenario uses Naive Bayes combined with TF-IDF. based on the test results, obtained accuracy on the LSTM method combined with Word Embedding with an f1 score of 87.98 % and accuracy obtained at Naive Bayes combined with TF-IDF with an f1 score of 76.77 %. From the tests that have been done, different results are obtained and have a big difference, which is 11.21%. The difference in the results of this classification is influenced by several factors, namely the first factor is the extraction of features used and the second is the data used. In feature selection, TF-IDF is more ideal for data that has a large or long document size because the representation seen from the whole document, in contrast to Word Embedding that is not affected by the data size because the representation is seen from words. so this is what causes the method of using LSTM combined with Word Embedding to produce higher results.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Code-switched and code-mixed languages are prevalent in multilingual societies, reflecting the complex interplay of cultures and languages in daily communication. Understanding the sentiment embedded in such texts is crucial for a range of applications, from improving social media analytics to enhancing customer feedback systems. Despite their significance, research in code-mixed and code-switched languages remains limited, particularly in less-resourced languages. This scarcity of research creates a gap in natural language processing (NLP) technologies, hindering their ability to accurately interpret the rich linguistic diversity of global communications. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel methodology for sentiment analysis in code-mixed and code-switched texts. Our approach combines the power of large language models (LLMs) and the versatility of the multilingual BERT (mBERT) framework to effectively process and analyze sentiments in multilingual data. By decomposing code-mixed texts into their constituent languages, employing mBERT for named entity recognition (NER) and sentiment label prediction, and integrating these insights into a decision-making LLM, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding sentiment in complex linguistic contexts. Our system achieves competitive rank on all subtasks in the Code-mixed Less-Resourced Sentiment analysis (Code-mixed) shared task at WILDRE-7 (LREC-COLING). © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association.},

Choosing appropriate social media marketing strategies to stimulate customer engagement in different forms is an important issue. In order to better understand customer behaviours in the social media marketing context, we draw on the Stimulus-Organism-Response theory, and conceptualise and characterise marketing posts from six dimensions to get various features as stimuli, which induce or activate customers’ cognitive and affective states to varying levels, and ultimately lead to different behaviour responses. Machine learning algorithms are applied to the customer engagement behaviour choice prediction when facing marketing posts. It is proved that the post features designed by humans can be used to get good predictions, while the best results are achieved by combining the human-designed features with the high-dimensional features automatically extracted from post texts by the BERT model.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of social media platforms as well as the current pandemic, the majority of activities are performed online. The user comments obtained from the digital channels are crucial in order that the agencies or organizations can improve and develop their brand. Thus, an automatic system is necessary to analyze the sentiment of a customer feedback. Recently, the well-known pre-trained language models for Vietnamese (PhoBERT) have achieved high performance in comparison with other approaches. However, this method may not focus on the local information in the sentiment like phrases or fragments. In this paper, we propose a PhoBERT-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) for text classification. The output of contextualized embeddings of the PhoBERT’s last four layers is fed into the CNN. This makes the network capable of obtaining more local information from the text. Besides, the PhoBERT output is also given to the transformer encoder layers in order to employ the self-attention technique, and this also makes the model more focused on the important information of the text segments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives competitive performance compared to the existing studies on three public datasets with Vietnamese texts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

By analyzing TV viewer ratings, Facebook activity and its sentiment, we aim to provide answers to how the transition from airing Winter Olympic Games on NRK to TV2 in Norway affected consumer behaviour and opinion. We used text classification and visual analytics methods on the business and social datasets. Our main finding is a clear link between negative sentiment and commercials. Despite positive change in customer behaviour, there was a negative change in customer opinion. Based on media events and broadcaster theories, we identify generalisable findings for all such transitions. © 2016 IEEE.},

Categorizing these customer transactions helps understand the market needs and trends while also assisting in building a personalized experience for each customer segment. In this paper, each transaction is accompanied by a free text description provided by the customer to describe the products to be picked up and delivered. These descriptions tend to be short, incoherent and code-mixed (Hindi-English) text.Here, we focus on a specific use-case where each customer transaction can be mapped to a single product category. We propose a cost-effective transaction classification approach based on proxy-labelling and knowledge distillation using the transaction descriptions provided by the customer. We introduce R-ALBERT, a model trained with RoBERTa as the "teacher"and ALBERT (33x fewer parameters than RoBERTa) as the "student". Further, we benchmark R-ALBERT on a large internal dataset as well as the 20Newsgroup dataset. We see that our model shows a 2% increase in performance with 33x fewer parameters. The model is currently deployed in production and is helping understand the customer behaviour across product categories and customer segments.  © 2022 ACM.},

However, non-English languages such as German face a scarcity of readily available corpora and evaluated methods for ABSA, making it a challenging problem. This paper addresses this gap by utilizing BERT-based transformer models, known for their exceptional performance in context-sensitive natural language processing tasks, to perform ABSA in a multi-label classification setting. We demonstrate our approach on a novel dataset of German hotel reviews that we have collected and annotated from TripAdvisor, thus contributing a new resource to the field and proving the effectiveness of our methodology. With achieving a micro f1-score of up to 0.91 for aspect category classification and 0.81 for end-to-end ABSA, our approach aligns with the performance of similar methods on other German-language datasets and surpasses performance achieved on English-language datasets in the hotel domain. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Customer feedback is an invaluable source of information for any organization, and crucial business phases such as market research, product development, and post-sale services may greatly benefit from it. Existing methods utilize qualitative data, surveys, and excel-generated reports to analyze customer complaints and feedback. However, it takes a while to gather information, classify appropriately, and analyze it manually before the data becomes useful information for the organization and the complaints are resolved simultaneously. To address these challenges, NLP is applied in this paper to categorize and examine user reviews and feedback using a laptop user feedback data set. The federated learning technique is used to ensure the privacy of the participating clients. In addition, it can properly handle uneven data distribution and lessen the load on the central server. After each federated training round, the FedAvg algorithm has been used to incorporate the local model learning into the central model. Three BERT variants (BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa) have experimented with federated learning for the classification task. The best result was obtained by the RoBERTa variant (71.59% accuracy for the independent and identical data distribution setting, 71.55% for the non-independent and non-identical setting). Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive system to produce product summaries and customer discontent reports based on graphical representations of the product and NLP-assisted classification of user reviews, complaints, and feedback according to their usage history. In the web application, the best-performing model variant is deployed and used. The simulation of the web application shows the successful execution of the proposed system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The competitive airline sector has grown at a breakneck pace in the last two decades. A useful source for collecting consumer feedback and performing various forms of analysis on it is proper data collection. This collection of data can be used for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a type of analysis that involves extracting sentiment to find attitudes and emotions associated with the text or data supplied. It's a classification approach in which machine learning techniques are used to identify positive and negative words or reviews in text-driven databases. Further to explain the reasons for negative comments, a word cloud and a bar graph are used. Sentiment analysis is used to analyze the Airline reviews dataset in this paper. To test the performance of sentiment analysis, many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been utilized, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree (DT), and each of these approaches has produced distinct results. The performance of Google's BERT algorithm has been evaluated to that of other machine learning algorithms in our research. Furthermore, this paper explores the Bert architecture, which has been pre-trained on two NLP tasks: Masked language modeling and Sentence prediction. The "Random Forest"is used as a baseline against which the results of the "BERT Model"are compared because its performance is the best among the machine learning models. In terms of performance criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, it is discovered that BERT outperformed the other ML techniques. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing number of reviews, it has become more important for businesses to analyze their customer's sentiments. This paper presents a framework that uses pre-trained language models such as BERT, XLNet, and Electra to analyze these sentiments. The framework is based on the Sentiment140 dataset which contains over 1.6 million tweets with tags. This collection of sentiments allows us to perform an evaluation of the models' performance. The goal of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of these models in categorizing and understanding the sentiments in customer reviews. BERT, for instance, has demonstrated exceptional performance in various tasks related to natural language processing. Another model that is transformer-based is XLNet, which adds more capabilities by utilizing permutation-based learning. On the other hand, the new generation of model, known as Electra, focuses on the generator discriminator learning. Through the incorporation of these models, we can leverage the contextual understanding of the sentiments in the customer reviews. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the performance of the different models in the framework for sentiment analysis. We tested their precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy in identifying and categorizing the sentiments in customer reviews. We also discuss the impact of adjusting the models on the task, as well as the tradeoffs between performance gains and computational resources. The findings of the study provided valuable information on the utilization of pre-trained models for analyzing customer reviews. We analyzed the performance of the different models BERT, XLNet, Electra, and BERT, revealing their weaknesses and strengths. This helps businesses identify the best model for their sentiment analysis needs. The study's findings have contributed to the advancement of sentiment analysis and natural language processing. It offers valuable recommendations that will aid in the future research efforts. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Customer review is constantly generated in the form of text based on customer opinion concerning specific products in the electronic (e)-commerce space. With the proliferation of data, the classification of customers’ opinions is a major issue in e-commerce. However, merchants frequently require customers to input their opinion about a product, in order to harvest customer experiences. The text classification technique helps customers and merchants to know if a product has a positive or negative review. This will enable merchants to improve the customer experience and also improve the revenue of the company. Sentiment analysis was executed on a customer product review dataset using support vector machine (SVM) in this study. The experimental results obtained show an accuracy of 86.67% in classifying customers’ opinions on selected products. The findings will guide merchants to know customer feedback and identify their needs to improve sales culminating in increased revenue. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {WeChat Business, developed on WeChat, the most extensively used instant messaging platform in China, is a new business model that bursts into people's lives in the e-commerce era. As one of the most typical WeChat Business behaviors, WeChat users can advertise products, advocate companies and share customer feedback to their WeChat friends by posting a WeChat Moment - a public status that contains images and a text. Given its popularity and significance, in this paper, we propose a novel Bilateral-Attention LSTM network (BiATT-LSTM) to identify WeChat Business Moments based on their texts and images. In particular, different from previous schemes that equally consider visual and textual modalities for a joint visual-textual classification task, we start our work with a text classification task based on an LSTM network, then we incorporate a bilateral-attention mechanism that can automatically learn two kinds of explicit attention weights for each word, namely 1) a global weight that is insensitive to the images in the same Moment with the word, and 2) a local weight that is sensitive to the images in the same Moment. In this process, we utilize visual information as a guidance to figure out the local weight of a word in a specific Moment. Two-level experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. It outperforms other schemes that jointly model visual and textual modalities. We also visualize the bilateral-attention mechanism to illustrate how this mechanism helps joint visual-textual classification. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to reviews and social media for a variety of applications, ranging from marketing to customer service. The difficulties of performing sentiment analysis in this domain can be overcome by leveraging on common-sense knowledge bases. Opinion Mining is a very challenging and promising discipline which is defined as an intersection of information retrieval and computational linguistic techniques to deal with the opinions expressed in a document. The main aim at solving the problems related to opinions about products, reviews ranking in movies, Politian in newsgroup posts, review sites etc. In this paper we are about to cover the source of data from where we take, its classification, evaluation process and then grouping techniques, tools used, and future challenges in opinion mining. Opinion mining consists of various stages such as extraction of data from various sources, text classification, grouping together and then evaluating it to positive or negative or true or false value. On the basis of our survey and analysis of the techniques, we provide an overall picture of what is involved in developing a software system for opinion mining. Any user, buyer or customer rely on the Web for their opinions on various products and services which they have used, it is very important to develop methods to automatically classify and evaluate them. The task of classifying and analysing such collective data together is known as customer feedback or review data, and is called as opinion mining. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {Understanding customer feedback is becoming a necessity for companies to identify problems and improve their products and services. Text classification and sentiment analysis can play a major role in analyzing this data by using a variety of machine and deep learning approaches. In this work, different transformer-based models are utilized to explore how efficient these models are when working with a German customer feedback dataset. In addition, these pre-trained models are further analyzed to determine if adapting them to a specific domain using unlabeled data can yield better results than off-the-shelf pre-trained models. To evaluate the models, two downstream tasks from the GermEval 2017 are considered. The experimental results show that transformer-based models can reach significant improvements compared to a fastText baseline and outperform the published scores and previous models. For the subtask Relevance Classification, the best models achieve a micro-averaged F1-Score of 96.1 % on the first test set and 95.9 % on the second one, and a score of 85.1 % and 85.3 % for the subtask Polarity Classification. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The challenge to decipher the voice of the customer (VOC) has multiplied many times today, as now the number of customer reviews are present in multiple platforms and the data to be analyzed is huge. Sentiment analysis, and text analytics using machine learning, deep learning tools and transformer-based tools can be applied to gather meaningful insights from these data. This paper applies the traditional machine learning tools of the Naive Bayes classifier, Random Forest and AdaBoost to predict the customer review ratings. These results are compared with deep learning methods of CNN, RNN and Bi-LSTM and transformer-based approaches of BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. The results show that RoBERTa has the highest accuracy among these methods. Paper also uses the explainable AI tool of LIME to understand the customer sentiments deeper in terms of why customers are giving a particular rating to the product. Business organizations will continue to use more and more AI tools to understand the customer feedback and the attempt in this paper is to learn how we can make predictions faster and more accurately. © The Author(s) 2022.},

However, the integration of sentiment analysis with research in design change prediction remains an untapped potential. This paper presents a method that uses social media sentiment analysis to identify opportunities for design change and the set of product components affected by the change. The method builds on natural language processing to determine change candidates from textual data and uses dependency modeling to reveal direct and indirect change propagation paths arising from the change candidates. The method was applied in a case example where 3665 YouTube comments on a diesel engine were analyzed. Based on the results, two engine components were recommended for design change with six others predicted as likely to be affected through change propagation. The findings suggest that the method can be used to aid decision quality in product planning through a better understanding of the change impact associated with the opportunities identified.

As an example, in business intelligence, they can be used to track the evolution of customer behaviors over time or to model relevant relationships. In this paper, we focus our attention on the domain of contact centers, where sequential data typically take the form of oral or written interactions, and word sequences often play a major role in text classification, and we investigate the connections between sequential data and text mining techniques. The main contribution of the paper is a new machine learning algorithm, called J48S, that associates semantic knowledge with telephone conversations. The proposed solution is based on the well-known C4.5 decision tree learner, and it is natively able to mix static, that is, numeric or categorical, data and sequential ones, such as texts, for classification purposes. The algorithm, evaluated in a real business setting, is shown to provide competitive classification performances compared with classical approaches, while generating highly interpretable models and effectively reducing the data preparation effort. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The top operating organizations understand an essential role that customer feedback plays in the business industry. These businesses then consistently listen to the feedbacks of the consumers to stay ahead in the competition. Customer feedback gives crucial insights into the workings of the product, services, and what could be done within the company's domain to make the experiences of the consumers better. Customer's opinions help the companies ensure that the final product actually shall suffice their expectations, solve their problems and meet their needs. Hence, the customer feedback is one of the most reliable and easy to get sources for tangible data that can also be used in making wise business decisions. The proposed approach provides a method to make effective use of this feedback and generate insights for the Product Team. Since it is not feasible to go through all reviews to find out what the customers are talking about, the reviews are clubbed together by Topic Modelling approach. The Business Team is presented with top keywords corresponding to each group of reviews which makes it easy for them to find out the actionable areas. The way the results are presented to the team guides them in the right direction so as to improve their products and services. A model is generated once the reviews have been labelled with topics. This is helpful to classify the new reviews which keep on coming from the customers' end. The Topic Modelling algorithm is again followed once the team has good number of new reviews which will further help in improving the model.  © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

Among the many applications of natural language processing in customer service discussed in this article are sentiment analysis, text categorization, and language creation. With the use of sentiment analysis, businesses may gauge the tone of a customer's feedback and tailor their response appropriately. Automatically forwarding customer service enquiries to the correct team is a viable use case for text categorization. Through the use of language generation, answers to commonly requested queries may be generated mechanically.Furthermore, the article delves into the economic gains that may result from using NLP in the service sector. Some examples of these advantages include reduced spending on administrative activities as a result of automating them, and an increase in sales as a result of happier customers. The necessity for extensive volumes of training data and the possibility of bias in the algorithms are two of the main obstacles and concerns for adopting NLP in customer service that are discussed in the article.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Temporal information plays a very important role in many analysis tasks, and can be encoded in at least two different ways. It can be modeled by discrete sequences of events as, for example, in the business intelligence domain, with the aim of tracking the evolution of customer behaviors over time. Alternatively, it can be represented by time series, as in the stock market to characterize price histories. In some analysis tasks, temporal information is complemented by other kinds of data, which may be represented by static attributes, e.g., categorical or numerical ones. This paper presents J48SS, a novel decision tree inducer capable of natively mixing static (i.e., numerical and categorical), sequential, and time series data for classification purposes. The novel algorithm is based on the popular C4.5 decision tree learner, and it relies on the concepts of frequent pattern extraction and time series shapelet generation. The algorithm is evaluated on a text classification task in a real business setting, as well as on a selection of public UCR time series datasets. Results show that it is capable of providing competitive classification performances, while generating highly interpretable models and effectively reducing the data preparation effort. © 2019 by the authors.

Feedback prediction and social media classification are crucial and play a key role in accurately identifying customer satisfaction. This paper presents sentiment analysis-based customer feedback prediction based on Twitter Arabic datasets of telecommunications companies in Saudi Arabia. The human brain, which contains billions of neurons, provides feedback based on the current and past experience provided by the services and other related stakeholders. Artificial Intelligent (AI) based methods, parallel to human brain processing methods such as Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, are famous for classifying and analyzing such datasets. Comparing the Arabic Dataset to English, it is pretty challenging for typical methods to outperform in the classification or prediction tasks. Therefore, the Arabic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (AraBERT) model was used and analyzed with various parameters such as activation functions and topologies and simulated customer satisfaction prediction takes using Arabic Twitter datasets. The prediction results were compared with two famous DL algorithms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Results show that these methods have been successfully applied and obtained highly accurate classification results. AraBERT achieved the best prediction accuracy among the three ML methods, especially with Mobily and STC datasets. © 2023 by the authors.},

The accuracy of predictions from contextbased sentiment and analysis of customer review data from various social media platforms are challenging and timeconsuming tasks due to the high volumes of unstructured data. In recent years, more research has been conducted based on the recurrent neural network algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) as well as hybrid, neutral, and traditional text classification algorithms. This paper presents our experimental research work to overcome these known challenges of the sentiment analysis models, such as its performance, accuracy, and context-based predictions. We've proposed a fine-tuned BERT model to predict customer sentiments through the utilization of customer reviews from Twitter, IMDB Movie Reviews, Yelp, Amazon. In addition, we compared the results of the proposed model with our custom Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), fastText, BiLSTM and hybrid fastText-BiLSTM models, as well as presented a comparative analysis dashboard report.

	abstract = {Psychiatric problems and disorders are an epidemic in their own right, however, they often go unnoticed & undetected. Post COVID-19, given that most families & individuals were forced to isolate themselves in their homes for huge periods of time, it only made things worse. We humans being social animals needed a refuge, therefore the volume of interactions & personal posts on social media platforms skyrocketed. Whilst, there's huge leverage of text classification techniques using Deep Learning algorithms for financial, commercial applications eg. stock market news analysis, analysing customer behavior, etc. but similar applications in the field of Mental health are quite meager. The text on the social media feed of a person can be critical and of huge help in expeditious detection of depressive disorders. Via the medium of this paper, our aim is to find an optimum solution for the above-addressed problem, we take the real-time user data from an online social networking platform, after which it is pre-processed and analysed, thereafter we use this data to build deep learning-based classifier models i.e. LSTM, (CNN+LSTM), GRU, these models are improved using optimisation algorithms, furthermore, these models are compared and analysed to check which text classification algorithm works best for our use case. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {this research investigates the use of transfer learning models, particularly BERT and LLaMA, for sentiment polarity classification in retail product reviews. Traditional machine learning techniques such as Naïve Bayes and SVM have struggled to capture nuanced linguistic patterns, including sarcasm, idiomatic expressions, and contextual shifts, due to their reliance on surface-level features and large labeled datasets. BERT and LLaMA, leveraging pre-Trained large language models, overcome these limitations by capturing deep contextual relationships and subtle language patterns with minimal manual feature engineering. BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism allows it to interpret sentiment by analyzing both the preceding and following words in a sentence, making it highly effective at detecting complex linguistic phenomena. LLaMA, optimized with quantization and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), offers computational efficiency while maintaining high performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments or real-Time applications. This study fine-Tunes both models on retail-specific datasets to enhance their ability to detect sentiment polarity, thereby providing more accurate and scalable solutions for businesses looking to understand customer feedback. Through model comparison, BERT and LLaMA outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in handling complex language structures. This research demonstrates the potential of these models to transform sentiment analysis in retail, leading to more informed decision-making and improved customer satisfaction. © 2024 IEEE.},

Coming to the text classification domain, lot of research is going into the sentiment analysis, wherein numerous approaches and strategies are used to obtain information about the customer's sentiments. In the past, only supervised, lexicon-based approaches and unsupervised machine learning-based techniques were used to process data. But nowadays, there is a rise in the application of nature-based algorithms. These algorithms are inspired by various social animals who use novel techniques to hunt down their preys or collect food. The very same approach is being simulated into a numerical optimization technique. To understand the same, this paper presents a systematic review of three different bio-mimicking procedures that are currently employed particularly in the arena of sentiment analysis namely Firefly Algorithm (FFA), Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) and Chicken Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSOA) from the years 2015-2022. © 2023 IEEE.},

It classifies the given text into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. The statement 'the picture quality of TV is good' expresses a positive opinion about a particular TV, while 'the sound is not adequate' expresses a negative opinion.

Subsequently, comments were automatically sorted using text classification algorithms based on assessments related to meal quality, surroundings, service, and price. A meticulously annotated dataset comprising approximately 4000 entries was used for training and testing purposes.

	abstract = {Due to the ever-changing business environment, enterprises are facing unprecedented challenges in their new-product development (NPD) processes, while the success and survival of NPD projects have become increasingly challenging in recent years. Thus, most enterprises are eager to revamp existing NPD processes so as to enhance the likelihood of new products succeeding in the market. In addition to the determination of sustainable new-product ideas and designs, new-product portfolio management (NPPM) is an active research area for allocating adequate resources to boost project development, while projects that perform poorly can be terminated. Since the existing new-product portfolio configuration is manually decided, this study explores the possibility of standardising NPPM, particularly the configuration mechanism, in a systematic manner. Subsequently, case-based reasoning can be applied to structure the entire NPPM process, in which past knowledge and successful cases can be used to configure new projects. Furthermore, customer feedback was analyzed using the transfer-learning-based text classification model in the case-retrieval process to balance the values of enterprises and customers. A new-product portfolio was therefore configured to facilitate NPPM under an agile–stage-gate model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, a case study in a printer manufacturing company was conducted, where positive feedback and performances were found. © 2022 by the authors.},

However, extracting and classify-ing beneficial information from texts can prove challeng-ing and time-consuming, particularly in complex lan-guages like Vietnamese. This study aims to classify the sentiment of Vietnamese comments on e-commerce websites into negative and positive classes. To enhance the performance of sentiment classification, the study fine-tuned traditional models of Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Then, this research proposed a combination of RNN and attention mechanisms at the word and word-and-sentence levels of the input document. The results showed an im-pressive accuracy of 93.72% and an F1 score of 93.7% on the RNN model with a word-and-sentence-level attention mechanism. This research outcome contributes to the field of text classification and could be applied in opinion mining, customer feedback analysis, and natural language processing.

It appears in many application domains, such as text classification, fraud detection, churn prediction and medical diagnosis. A widely used approach to cope with this problem at the data level is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) which uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to generate new, artificial instances in the minority class. It is however known that SMOTE is not ideal for high-dimensional data. Therefore, we propose an alternative oversampling strategy for imbalanced classification problems in high dimensions. Our approach is based on the sparse inverse covariance matrix estimated trough the Ledoit-Wolf method for high-dimensional data. The results show that our proposal has a competitive performance with respect to popular competitors. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {During the last decades, the reliance on email communication, especially in business, has increased significantly. Companies receive a massive amount of emails daily, that include business inquiries, customers’ feedback, and other types of emails. This inspired many researchers to propose different algorithms to classify and redistribute the numerous emails according to their content. Nowadays, emails containing Arabic text, especially in the Arab world, have raised an increasing concern since they became widely used in official correspondence. Nevertheless, just a small amount of literature focuses on Arabic text classification. Therefore, this work addresses Arabic business emails classification based on natural language processing (NLP). A dataset of 63,257 emails was used and the emails were classified as: urgency, sentiment, and topic classification. The proposed models are based on machine learning techniques and a lexicon of words on which the emails are identified. The models are composed of different settings of convolutional neural networks (CNN). A separate model was built, trained, and tested for each category. The results were promising and gave an accuracy of about 92% and a loss of less than 8%. They also proved the correctness and robustness of this work. © 2023, Masri and Al-Jabi.

	abstract = {The large-scale nature of product catalog and the changing demands of customer queries makes product search a challenging problem. The customer queries are ambiguous and implicit. They may be looking for an exact match of their query, or a functional equivalent (i.e., substitute), or an accessory to go with it (i.e., complement). It is important to distinguish these three categories from merely classifying an item for a customer query as relevant or not. This information can help direct the customer and improve search applications to understand the customer mission. In this paper, we formulate search relevance as a multi-class classification problem and propose a graph-based solution to classify a given query-item pair as exact, substitute, complement, or irrelevant (ESCI). The customer engagement (clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases) between query and items serve as a crucial information for this problem. However, existing approaches rely purely on the textual information (such as BERT) and do not sufficiently focus on the structural relationships. Another challenge in including the structural information is the sparsity of such data in some regions. We propose Structure-Aware multilingual LAnguage Model (SALAM), that utilizes a language model along with a graph neural network, to extract region-specific semantics as well as relational information for the classification of query-product pairs. Our model is first pre-trained on a large region-agnostic dataset and behavioral graph data and then fine-tuned on region-specific versions to address the sparsity. We show in our experiments that SALAM significantly outperforms the current matching frameworks on the ESCI classification task in several regions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using a two-phased training setup (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning) in capturing region-specific information. Also, we provide various challenges and solutions for using the model in an industrial setting and outline its contribution to the e-commerce engine.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the strong and outstanding development of the Internet, the need to refer to the feedback of previous customers when shopping online is increasing. Therefore, websites are developed to allow users to share experiences, reviews, comments and feedback about the services and products of businesses and organizations. The organizations also collect user feedback about their products and services to give better directions. However, with a large amount of user feedback about certain services and products, it is difficult for users, businesses, and organizations to pay attention to them all. Thus, an automatic system is necessary to analyze the sentiment of a customer feedback. Recently, the well-known pre-trained language models for Vietnamese (PhoBERT) achieved high performance in comparison with other approaches. However, this method may not focus on the local information in the text like phrases or fragments. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on PhoBERT for sentiment classification. The output of contextualized embeddings of the PhoBERT's last four layers is fed into the CNN. This makes the network capable of obtaining more local information from the sentiment. Besides, the PhoBERT output is also given to the transformer encoder layers in order to employ the self-attention technique, and this also makes the model more focused on the important information of the sentiment segments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach gives competitive performance compared to the existing studies on three public datasets with the opinions of Vietnamese people.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of e-commerce, posting online product reviews expressing customer’s sentiment or opinion towards products has grown exponentially. Sentiment analysis is a computational method that plays an essential role in automating the extraction of subjective information i.e. customer’s sentiment or opinion from online product reviews. Two approaches commonly used in Sentiment analysis tasks are supervised approaches and lexicon-based approaches. In supervised approaches, Sentiment analysis is seen as a text classification task. The result depends not only on the robustness of the machine learning algorithm but also on the utilized features. Bag-of-word is a common utilized features. As a statistical feature, bag-of-word does not take into account semantic of words. Previous research has indicated the potential of semantic in supervised SA task. To augment the result of sentiment analysis, this paper proposes a method to extract text features named sentence level features (SLF) and domain sensitive features (DSF) which take into account semantic of words in both sentence level and domain level of product reviews. A word sense disambiguation based method was adapted to extract SLF. For every similarity employed in generating SLF, the SentiCircle-based method was enhanced to generate DSF. Results of the experiments indicated that our proposed semantic features i.e. SLF and SLF + DSF favorably increase the performance of supervised sentiment analysis on product reviews. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Companies generate a lot of data that contain customer feedback data like reviews about their products and services. In addition, online customer reviews play a significant role in helping the company improve its sales and increase its customer base. Customer reviews are feedback given to businesses and Retailers based on the customer's experience with their organization. Companies use them to improve upon their existing service or the product they are selling. For example, in an e-commerce-driven world, where people have no physical access to the goods they wish to purchase, many customers will turn to online reviews to get an opinion on what to buy. E-commerce is changing how people buy products and services. For example, many businesses look at past data to increase customer count. In this context, companies can use customer reviews on their products to promote their high sales and gain a competitive edge in the market. This paper focuses on classifying the sentiment of customer reviews using machine learning approaches. The models are evaluated using various metrics like confusion matrix, AUROC curve, and classification report. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In this era of the information age, a major number of people spend their time on social networking sites. Among different social networking sites, Facebook is one of the most popular due to its accessibility and many other reasons. Nowadays, people use Facebook not only for general purposes but also for business purposes as it provides free opportunity to promote products and services. Users of the products or services share their opinion and feedback on the Facebook page. The amount of the users' data regarding the opinion and feedback is huge. This is very essential to analyze this vast amount of data and extract knowledge from it. For business owners, it is important to consider their clients' sentiments as proper analysis of customers' feedback helps them to take better future planning. In this research work, we proposed a noble strategy to predict users' sentiments from their Facebook comments on online food delivery services. To accomplish this research work, we have mainly considered the BERT machine learning technique. To understand the performance of the BERT in this context, we have applied Char-CNN, Graph-CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM machine learning techniques also. Lastly, the obtained result of the BERT is compared with other four applied techniques in terms of performance evaluation techniques. It is found that BERT outperforms the other applied techniques with achieving the accuracy of 92.86%. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Understanding attitudes regarding distinct topics and public opinions on the sentimental analysis of social media data is important. This research analyses the real-time twitter sentiments using deep learning. The major objective of the study is to create an efficient sentiment analysis algorithm to accurately ensure the sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative) of tweets. This study proposed a deep learning approach to capture the contextual information and complex patterns in social media data which leverages the power of neutral networks. To assess the performance of the algorithm the study relies on the evaluation of F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall through rigorous evaluation metrics. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the numerical outcomes of the study. A novel contribution is provided with a specific emphasis on real-time Twitter sentiments by the study to enhance the sentiment analysis techniques for social media data. The significant implication from accurate and timely analysis of Twitter sentiments for several applications includes public opinion tracking, brand management, customer feedback analysis, and reputation monitoring. The potential to provide significant insights to researchers, organisations and business can be made from promptly addressing the sentiments expressed on real time data of twitter. © Authors retain all copyrights.},

	abstract = {With the speedy growth of online shopping, it has become of crucial importance for product makers to analyze, and handle a wealth of products' reviews. However, such a high volume of reviews, along with a wide variety of opinions, makes it hard for manufacturers to know exactly how they can improve their products without having an efficient approach. For this purpose, the results of sentiment classification would help the customers to retrieve the necessary information to choose an appropriate product, and the sellers to effectively collect customer feedback in order to improve their products. Like most of the read-world problems, the shopping review data being used in this study were imbalanced, being predominately composed of positive with only a small percentage of negative reviews. Machine learning (ML) algorithms do not perform well when data are imbalanced, as they tend to get biased toward the overrepresented data category. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to address this class imbalance problem. In this study, three different ML-based algorithms, namely the Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine, and decision tree (DT) were employed. An extensive preprocessing procedure was taken to prepare the text datasets, and details are discussed in the manuscript. The performance analysis indicated that the DT algorithm outperforms the other two methods. As positive reviews account for the majority of the reviews, sparse words removal for the data resulted in the removal of almost all negative reviews' sentiments. Hence, the model training process is here performed on positive and negative reviews separately. A combination of the review titles with their contents, separate tokenization process, applications of various N-gram, and maintaining stops words (e.g. “not” or “but”) were some other steps considered to improve the performance of the model. © 2020 The Authors.

In the experiments, we compare the approach with other transformer-based models such as XLM-R, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and BERT. The experimental results show that the proposed method can bypass the state-of-the-art methods related to the UIT-ViSFD corpus.

Setur implemented a systematic approach to collecting customer feedback by distributing "after-stay surveys'' to its customers via email following the completion of the agency services provided. Guest answers to open-ended questions that gather opinions about travel experience are analyzed by four tasks: user intention for answering, the sentiment of the review, subjects touched upon, and whom it concerned. For these tasks, transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and Electra are fine-Tuned to classify customer reviews. Based on the test results, it is observed that best practices could be gathered using Bert. In addition, we showed that different insights can be obtained from text comments made for two hotels in Aydin, Turkiye. Some users made complaints using neutral sentences.

	abstract = {Text classification is a common task in machine learning. One of the supervised classification algorithm called Random Forest has been generally used for this task. There is a group of parameters in Random Forest classifier which need to be tuned. If proper tuning is performed on these hyperparameters, the classifier will give a better result. This paper proposes a hybrid approach of Random Forest classifier and Grid Search method for customer feedback data analysis. The tuning approach of Grid Search is applied for tuning the hyperparameters of Random Forest classifier. The Random Forest classifier is used for customer feedback data analysis and then the result is compared with the results which get after applying Grid Search method. The proposed approach provided a promising result in customer feedback data analysis. The experiments in this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model to predict the sentiment on customer feedback data is greater than the performance accuracy obtained by the model without applying parameter tuning. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.},

With regards to creating a better understanding of the online shopper's intent on site, an effective search engine is the best tool for improving the user experience. A useful search engine needs to produce fast results and do intent analysis of customers correctly to present successful recommendations. In this study, BERT, ELECTRA and RoBERTa which are language models that give successful results in similar problems and pre-training libraries in Turkish languages are used for developing text classification and customer intent analysis models based on e-commerce product categories. The results of these deep learning models, which were optimized using the product description and comment libraries of the selected e-commerce brand, are shared in a comparative way, and the results of our e-commerce end-user intent analysis model, which was tested on user search history, were detailed on the basis of product category. The developed model can be used for e-commerce product prioritization in Turkish language, as well as creating an infrastructure for the development of intent analysis models that are able to predict as far as the main product that the user wants to display in searches containing multiple products. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Customer loyalty is important for many industries, including banking, telecommunications, gaming, and shopping, in terms of sustainability. In mobile applications, it is observed that the demand rises with the usage of mobile devices such as smartphones. Therefore, it is important to predict when players tend to leave an application. Most of the studies so far focus on churn prediction or customer loyalty in mobile applications by analyzing demographic, economic, and behavioral data about customers. In this work, we introduce sentiment analysis-based customer loyalty prediction in mobile applications using word embeddings, deep learning algorithms, and deep contextualized word representations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate loyalty of customers analyzing sentiments of users from their comments using deep learning, word embedding, and deep contextualized word representation models. For this purpose, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, BERT, MBERT, DistilBERT, RoBERT are used for classification purpose. On the other hand, word embedding models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are employed for text representation. To demonstrate the impact of proposed model, comprehensive experiments are performed on seven different datasets. The experiment results show sentiment analysis of users in mobile applications can be a powerful indicator in terms of predicting customer loyalty. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Numerous numbers of companies have utilized the web to offer their services and products. Web customers dependably look through the reviews of other customers towards a product or service before they chose to buy the things or viewed the films. The company needs to analyse their customers’ sentiment and feeling based on their comments. The outcome of the sentiment analysis makes the companies easily discover either the expression of their users is more to positive or negative. There are numerous numbers of sentiment analysis techniques available in the market today. However, only three (3) techniques will be used in this research which are the Python NLTK Text Classification, Miopia and MeaningCloud. These techniques used to analyse the sentiment analysis of the reviews and comments from English language in social media. 2400 datasets from Amazon, Kaggle, IMdB, and Yelp were used to analyse the accuracy of these techniques. From this analyses, average accuracy for sentiment analysis using Python NLTK Text Classification is 74.5%, meanwhile only 73% accuracy achieved using Miopia technique. The accuracy achieved when using MeaningCloud technique is 82.1% which is the highest compared to other techniques. This shows that hybrid technique offers a greatest accuracy for sentiment analysis on social reviews. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a fascinating area as a natural language understanding benchmark to evaluate customers' feedback and needs. Moreover, sentiment analysis can be applied to understand the people's reactions to public events such as the presidential elections and disease pandemics. Recent works in sentiment analysis on COVID-19 present a domain-targeted Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) language model, COVID-Twitter BERT (CT-BERT). However, there is little improvement in text classification using a BERT-based language model directly. Therefore, an auxiliary approach using BERT was proposed. This method converts single-sentence classification into pair-sentence classification, which solves the performance issue of BERT in text classification tasks. In this paper, we combine a pre-trained BERT model from COVID-related tweets and the auxiliary-sentence method to achieve better classification performance on COVID tweets sentiment analysis. We show that converting single-sentence classification into pair-sentence classification extends the dataset and obtains higher accuracies and F1 scores. However, we expect a domain-specific language model would perform better than a general language model. In our results, we show that the performance of CT-BERT does not necessarily outperform BERT specifically in understanding sentiments. © 2021 ACM.},

An assessment was conducted on the performance of three algorithms for machine learning Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis of user-generated content on Twitter. A thorough methodology was implemented, including gathering data, preprocessing, extracting features, and evaluating the model to assess how well these methods work. Methods like TFIDF and n-grams enhanced the model's understanding of contextual sentiment. SVM exhibited high accuracy, attributed to its exceptional capability to manage high-dimensional data and establish robust decision boundaries. Nonetheless, challenges persist in interpreting neutral sentiments and ambiguous language. The investigation into complex deep learning methods, encompassing recurrent Transformers and neural networks, presents opportunities for additional advancements in sentiment classification.

Consequently, machine learning techniques, such as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), have gained prominence for their ability to determine sentiment at the aspect level. This study aims to fine-tune natural language processing models for aspect extraction in e-commerce customer reviews. We manually annotated 2781 online user review sentences in English and employed different extensions of the BERT model to identify implicit and explicit aspects. This approach diverges from prior studies, as our dataset comprises real user reviews from five prominent e-commerce platforms. The findings demonstrate the models’ effectiveness in extracting aspects from diverse e-commerce user reviews, yielding a deeper understanding of user-generated content and customer satisfaction trends, and providing valuable insights for managerial decision-making.

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) has recently developed an automated approach for assessing sentiment, emotion, and these reviews or opinions to extract relevant and subjective information from text-based data. Analyzing sentiment on social networks, such as Twitter, has become a powerful means of learning about the users’ opinions and better understanding and satisfaction. However, it consumes time and energy to disperse and collect surveys from clients, often inaccurate and inconsistent, and evaluating and improving the accuracy of the methods in sentiment analysis is being hindered by the challenges encountered in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper uses NLP, text analysis, biometrics, and computational linguistics to detect and extract replies, moods, or emotions from Skytrax Airline Customers' Feedback SACF data. This research uses deep learning models to analyze various approaches applied to small SACF to solve sentiment analysis problems. We applied word embedding (Glove embedding models) to improve the sentiment classification performance of a series of datasets extensively utilized for feature extractions. Finally, a comparative study has been conducted on the SACF data analysis utilizing deep learning (DL)for evaluating the performance of the different models and input features, which is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CONV1D), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for application to big datasets in 2019. This approach was assessed using each classification technique; the precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics for sentiment analysis have been identified. And The results show that LSTM outperforms in classification accuracy; the outcome was 91%. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a useful technique for extracting opinions from unstructured data that includes language like product and movie reviews. It can be used to gather customer feedback, evaluate brand perception, and conduct market research. In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis of Twitter data has recently emerged as a popular topic. Twitter data sets are compiled using the Twitter API and contain real-time tweets about various topics. Automated text analysis is used to determine public opinion on specific issues. Although many machine learning algorithms are utilized for this purpose, previous approaches have failed to enhance the accuracy of categorization and classification as per industry requirements. To address this issue, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework was introduced. This approach was applied to analyze airline customer feedback data from Twitter, and it resulted in improved classification performance. However, the LSTM framework achieve better performance for small and medium size datasets only. The performance degraded when applicable for large amount of data. To address the limitation of LSTM framework, in this research work proposed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) classification and the Ranger AdaBelief optimizer. The BERT classifier is used for classification, and Ranger AdaBelief is employed to optimize loss during the classification process. The proposed model achieved better results than previous research, with an accuracy of 92.54%, precision of 90.15%, recall of 90.24%, and F1-score of 91.14%. The BERT classification with Ranger AdaBelief optimizer significantly outperformed previous approaches for sentiment analysis classification. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, accurately matching products to their relevant categories is crucial for improving search functionality, enhancing user experience, and driving sales. To address this challenge, this research paper proposes an innovative evaluation and annotation methodology that leverages the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for product category matching. The primary goal of this study is to develop an efficient and reliable system that can automatically categorize products into appropriate groups based on their descriptions, titles, and other relevant attributes. To achieve this, we employ GPT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing model known for its proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. The research methodology follows a multi-step approach. Firstly, a large dataset comprising product descriptions and corresponding categories is collected from diverse e-commerce platforms. Next, this dataset is carefully annotated by domain experts to establish ground truth category assignments. During the annotation process, specific challenges related to ambiguous product descriptions and overlapping categories are addressed to ensure high-quality annotations. Subsequently, the pre-trained GPT model is fine-tuned on the annotated dataset using transfer learning techniques. The fine-tuned model is then evaluated using various performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, to quantify its effectiveness in categorizing products accurately. To validate the proposed methodology, extensive experiments are conducted on a representative set of e-commerce products. A comparative analysis is performed by benchmarking the GPT-based approach against traditional rule-based methods and other popular deep learning models in the field of text classification. The results demonstrate the superiority of the GPT-based model in product category matching, exhibiting significant improvements over existing methods. The research findings highlight the model's ability to capture complex semantic relationships between products and categories, leading to more accurate and context-aware categorization. This research paper contributes a robust evaluation and annotation methodology for product category matching in e-commerce using GPT. The study establishes the effectiveness of GPT in enhancing the performance of product categorization systems and showcases its potential in revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape. The proposed methodology holds promising implications for online retailers seeking to optimize product discovery, customer engagement, and overall user satisfaction. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of player-versus-player games and tournaments has catapulted esports games into a rapidly expanding force in the gaming industry. However, novice and armature players' voices are often inadvertently overlooked because of a lack of effective analytical methods, despite the close collaboration between professional esports teams and operators. To ensure the quality of esports game services and establish a balanced gaming environment, it is essential to consider the opinions of unprofessional players and comprehensively analyze their reviews. This study proposes a new framework for analyzing esports reviews of players. It incorporates two key components: topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Utilizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, the framework effectively identifies diverse topics within reviews. These identified topics were subsequently employed in a prevalence analysis to uncover the associations between players' concerns and various esports games. Moreover, it leverages cutting-edge Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in conjunction with a Transformer (TFM) downstream layer, enabling accurate detection of players' sentiments toward different topics. We experimented using a dataset containing 1.6 million English reviews collected up to December 2021 for four esports games on Steam: TEKKEN7, Dota2, PUBG, and CS:GO. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework can efficiently identify players' concerns and reveal interesting keywords underlying their reviews. Consequently, it provides precise insights and valuable customer feedback to esports game operators, enabling them to enhance their services and provide an improved gaming experience for all players.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The scale of emotions and opinions can vary from positive to negative and maybe neutral. Customer sentiment analysis helps businesses to point out the public’s thoughts and feelings about their products, brands, or services in online conversations and feedback. Natural language processing and text classification are crucial for sentiment analysis. That means we can predict or classify customers’ opinions given their comments. In this paper, we do sentiment analysis in the two different movie review datasets using various machine learning techniques including decision tree, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, blending, voting, and recurrent neural networks (RNN). We propose a few frameworks of sentiment classification using these techniques on the given datasets. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate them and compared with an outstanding natural language processing tool (Stanford CoreNLP) at present.

	abstract = {Internet applications such as Online Social Networking and Electronic commerce are becoming incredibly common, resulting in more content being available. Recommender systems (RS) assist users in identifying appropriate information out of a large pool of options. In today’s internet applications, RS are extremely important. To increase user satisfaction, this type of system supports personalized recommendations based on a massive volume of data. These suggestions assist clients in selecting products, while concerns can increase product utilization. We discovered that much research work is going on in the field of recommendation and that there are some effective systems out there. In the context of social information, sentimental analysis (SA) can aid in increasing the knowledge of a user’s behaviour, views, and reactions, which is helpful for incorporating into RS to improve recommendation accuracy. RS has been found to resolve information overload challenges in information retrieval, but they still have issues with cold-start and data sparsity. SA, on the other hand, is well-known for interpreting text and conveying user choices. It’s frequently used to assist E-Commerce in tracking customer feedback on their products and attempting to comprehend customer needs and preferences. To improve the accuracy and correctness of any RS, this paper proposes a recommendation model based on a Hybrid Recommendation Model (HRM) and hybrid SA. In the proposed method, we first generate a preliminary recommendation list using a HRM. To generate the final recommendation list, the HRM with SA is used. In terms of various evaluation criteria, the HRM with SA outperforms traditional models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Query categorization is an essential part of query intent understanding in e-commerce search. A common query categorization task is to select the relevant fine-grained product categories in a product taxonomy. For frequent queries, rich customer behavior (e.g., click-through data) can be used to infer the relevant product categories. However, for more rare queries, which cover a large volume of search traffic, relying solely on customer behavior may not suffice due to the lack of this signal. To improve categorization of rare queries, we adapt the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) approach to utilize the latent knowledge embedded in semantically or lexically similar product documents to enrich the representation of the more rare queries. To this end, we propose a novel deep neural model named Attentive Pseudo Relevance Feedback Network (APRF-Net) to enhance the representation of rare queries for query categorization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect search queries from a large commercial search engine, and compare APRF-Net to state-of-the-art deep learning models for text classification. Our results show that the APRF-Net significantly improves query categorization by 5.9% on F1@1 score over the baselines, which increases to 8.2% improvement for the rare (tail) queries. The findings of this paper can be leveraged for further improvements in search query representation and understanding. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Sentiment classification is an instrument of natural language processing tasks in text analysis to measure customer feedback from given documents such as product reviews, news, and texts. This research aims to experiment with Thai financial news sentiment classification and evaluate sentiment classification performance. In this research, we show financial news sentiment classification experimental results when comparing supervised and semi-supervised methods. In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language. From this study, we observe the importance of sentiment classification tools between supervised and semi-supervised learning, and we look forward to furthering this work. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

	abstract = {In this era of social media, understanding consumer emotions in real-time is crucial for businesses to adapt and enhance their offerings promptly. This study delves into real-time consumer emotion analysis in the e-commerce industry using social media data, propelled by the publicly available GoEmotion dataset sourced from Reddit. This dataset encompasses 58,000 comments meticulously labeled for 28 emotion categories, providing an abundant source for sentiment analysis and emotion classification, especially relevant to the e-commerce sector. Released in 2020, this dataset offers a contemporary view of consumer emotions on social media. Human annotators diligently labeled each comment, resulting in a dataset that accurately mirrors users' emotions across diverse Reddit topics. Advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), were employed to categorise the emotions expressed in the comments. The practical result of this research is a machine learning model integrated with a user interface, delivering actionable insights derived from real-time Twitter data to e-commerce companies. This integration allows businesses to tailor their products and services in alignment with consumer sentiments expressed on Twitter. Notably, the model achieved a substantial improvement in macro-average precision (0.54) compared to previous work (0.40). The BERT model demonstrated exceptional proficiency in predicting specific emotions like gratitude, love, and admiration, boasting F1-scores of 0.82, 0.57, and 0.48, respectively. Additionally, the CNN model excelled in predicting 'gratitude,' demonstrating impressive precision, recall, and F1-scores. The study aims to identify the most prevalent emotions and empower businesses to customise their products and services accordingly. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since the spread of the coronavirus flu in 2019 (hereafter referred to as COVID-19), millions of people worldwide have been affected by the pandemic, which has significantly impacted our habits in various ways. In order to eradicate the disease, a great help came from unprecedentedly fast vaccines development along with strict preventive measures adoption like lockdown. Thus, world wide provisioning of vaccines was crucial in order to achieve the maximum immunization of population. However, the fast development of vaccines, driven by the urge of limiting the pandemic caused skeptical reactions by a vast amount of population. More specifically, the people’s hesitancy in getting vaccinated was an additional obstacle in fighting COVID-19. To ameliorate this scenario, it is important to understand people’s sentiments about vaccines in order to take proper actions to better inform the population. As a matter of fact, people continuously update their feelings and sentiments on social media, thus a proper analysis of those opinions is an important challenge for providing proper information to avoid misinformation. More in detail, sentiment analysis (Wankhade et al. in Artif Intell Rev 55(7):5731–5780, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10144-1) is a powerful technique in natural language processing that enables the identification and classification of people feelings (mainly) in text data. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms and other computational techniques to analyze large volumes of text and determine whether they express positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is widely used in industries such as marketing, customer service, and healthcare, among others, to gain actionable insights from customer feedback, social media posts, and other forms of unstructured textual data. In this paper, Sentiment Analysis will be used to elaborate on people reaction to COVID-19 vaccines in order to provide useful insights to improve the correct understanding of their correct usage and possible advantages. In this paper, a framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods is proposed for classifying tweets based on their polarity values. We analyzed Twitter data related to COVID-19 vaccines after the most appropriate pre-processing on them. More specifically, we identified the word-cloud of negative, positive, and neutral words using an artificial intelligence tool to determine the sentiment of tweets. After this pre-processing step, we performed classification using the BERT + NBSVM model to classify people’s sentiments about vaccines. The reason for choosing to combine bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and Naive Bayes and support vector machine (NBSVM) can be understood by considering the limitation of BERT-based approaches, which only leverage encoder layers, resulting in lower performance on short texts like the ones used in our analysis. Such a limitation can be ameliorated by using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine approaches that are able to achieve higher performance in short text sentiment analysis. Thus, we took advantage of both BERT features and NBSVM features to define a flexible framework for our sentiment analysis goal related to vaccine sentiment identification. Moreover, we enrich our results with spatial analysis of the data by using geo-coding, visualization, and spatial correlation analysis to suggest the most suitable vaccination centers to users based on the sentiment analysis outcomes. In principle, we do not need to implement a distributed architecture to run our experiments as the available public data are not massive. However, we discuss a high-performance architecture that will be used if the collected data scales up dramatically. We compared our approach with the state-of-art methods by comparing most widely used metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure. The proposed BERT + NBSVM outperformed alternative models by achieving 73% accuracy, 71% precision, 88% recall and 73% F-measure for classification of positive sentiments while 73% accuracy, 71% precision, 74% recall and 73% F-measure for classification of negative sentiments respectively. These promising results will be properly discussed in next sections. The use of artificial intelligence methods and social media analysis can lead to a better understanding of people’s reactions and opinions about any trending topic. However, in the case of health-related topics like COVID-19 vaccines, proper sentiment identification could be crucial for implementing public health policies. More in detail, the availability of useful findings on user opinions about vaccines can help policymakers design proper strategies and implement ad-hoc vaccination protocols according to people’s feelings, in order to provide better public service. To this end, we leveraged geospatial information to support effective recommendations for vaccination centers. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis, which is a vital component in NLP, plays an essential role across various platforms, including customer feedback classification. SA has appeared as an automated method for evaluating sentiment and emotion in textual content, enabling the extraction of relevant subjective information from reviews and notions within text-based data. This examination centers around the utilization of pioneering feeling examination procedures, explicitly using the transformer models, to unscramble the nuanced opinions implanted in aircraft audits. In the time of computerized correspondence, online surveys have turned into a basic source of criticism, mirroring travelers' encounters and judgements. Understanding and investigating these feelings can give significant experiences to carriers to upgrade their administrations and consumer loyalty. By utilizing the strength of transformer model such as BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, the examination expects to achieve a distinguished degree of correctness in sentiment characterization, empowering carriers to perceive positive and negative opinions as well as the tones inside. This research seeks to provide a clear discrepancy between positive or negative feedbacks and employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, text analysis, to distinguish and extract positive and negative feedback, as well as emotions from the 'Airline reviews' dataset. Through the integration of advanced AI techniques, the study aims to achieve a nuanced understanding of sentiments uttered within the dataset. This paper emphases on accurately detecting and categorizing feedback based on its positive or negative feedback, and also capturing the emotional tones implanted in the reviews. This is an experimental approach and this study is done to find out the precise and more accurate outcome from the 'Airline reviews' dataset using an effective transformer model and comparing this model's accuracy with other available models.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rise of online social networks has revolutionized the way businesses and consumers interact, creating new opportunities for customer word-of-mouth (WoM) and brand advocacy. Understanding and managing customer advocacy in the online realm has become crucial for businesses aiming to cultivate a positive brand image and engage with their target audience effectively. In this study, we propose a framework that leverages the pre-trained XLNet- (bi-directional long-short term memory) BiLSTM- conditional random field (CRF) architecture to construct a Knowledge Graph (KG) for social customer advocacy in online customer engagement (CE). The XLNet-BiLSTM-CRF model combines the strengths of XLNet, a powerful language representation model, with BiLSTM-CRF, a sequence labeling model commonly used in natural language processing tasks. This architecture effectively captures contextual information and sequential dependencies in CE data. The XLNet-BiLSTM-CRF model is evaluated against several baseline architectures, including variations of BERT integrated with other models, to compare their performance in identifying brand advocates and capturing CE dynamics. Additionally, an ablation study is conducted to analyze the contributions of different components in the model. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrate that the XLNet-BiLSTM-CRF model outperforms the baseline architectures, indicating its superior ability to accurately identify brand advocates and label customer advocacy entities. The findings highlight the significance of leveraging pre-trained contextual embeddings, sequential modeling, and sequence labeling techniques in constructing effective models for constructing a KG for customer advocacy in online engagement. The proposed framework contributes to the understanding and management of customer advocacy by facilitating meaningful customer-brand interactions and fostering brand loyalty. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet has become a crucial space for customer feedback and the budding of various ideologies across different cultures. But some people provide their opinions whose sole meaning is different from what their figurative meanings imply. This sophisticated form of sentiment expression through mockery or irony is called sarcasm. Sarcastic form of texts has taken a prominent place in social media and their growth has become exponential in recent years through messages and posts. Sarcastic comments, tweets, or feedback can be misleading in data mining activities and may result in wrong predictions since the boundaries of the sarcastic context are not well defined. There is a need to model new systems that can precisely define the boundaries of the sentence and detect sarcasm in them. Different methods of classification have been used for sarcasm detection in various works including deep learning, neural networks, and other architectures. This paper focuses on combining the capabilities of both Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for detecting sarcastic content from text. A BERT-GCN architecture is proposed which takes as input, the graph, and text representations and learns the complex structural and semantic patterns in the text, thereby detecting sarcastic content. The efficiency of BERT-GCN is compared with various baseline methods. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to study the validity of using pre-trained transformers to extract customer sentiment from written reviews. Internet retailing and e-commerce have enabled users to post reviews expressing their opinions about products and services. Online customer reviews support not just new customers, who can use these prompt actionable pieces of information to decide on their purchase, but also business and research areas, who can use it to obtain the changing and emerging customer and market requirements, i.e., the voice of the customer. Although customer online reviews may be very subjective, the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods to extract relevant customer feedback is in order. Recently, transformers took Natural Language Processing (NLP) by storm breaking state-of-the-art benchmarks on every NLP task. Design/methodology/approach: Five pre-trained transformer models (Finbert, Bert-base, Finbert-tone, DistilRoberta, and Twitter-Roberta) are applied to an Amazon database of automotive products for opinion mining/sentiment analysis of written reviews, which are then compared with the quantitative 5-star rating given by the consumer. Considering the 5-points Likert scale in the star rating, the comparison to each model prediction was done by mapping the stars given on the dataset into 3 classes, where the positive sentiment is equal to five and four stars, the neutral is equal to three stars, and the negative is equal to one and two stars. A 6th ensemble model was also developed to take in the predictions from the transformers and make a prediction. This model was added to investigate if a pipeline would perform better than a single transformer. Findings: The results indicate that although transformers may be a useful tool to extract customer satisfaction from customer reviews, choosing an appropriate model is critical to obtaining reliable metrics. Among the tested models, the “Twitter-Roberta” presented the higher performance in predicting the correct customer sentiment within this paper. It was also found that adding an ensemble of transformers to make the final prediction improves performance. The ensemble model is the best one. Practical implications: An automated sentiment assessment system can be useful to identify customer satisfaction from written text collected across the web and particularly on social media, or via the usual enterprise communication channels. This data can then be used in a multitude of practical scenarios, such as product review monitoring; market research; recommender systems; and prescreening of customer communications (web forms, email). Using our methodology, the use of transformers becomes much more accessible since training a transformer from scratch is beyond reach for most organizations. Originality/value: Text-mining techniques for customer satisfaction is a well-studied field. Since its inception, it has been used to do sentiment analysis, including transformers. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the use of “off-the-shelf” pre-trained transformer models in this context was not found, particularly in the proposed pipeline, with a final ensemble model to leverage and improve the different predictions of the different transformers. © 2022 Universidade do Minho.

This paper unveils a pioneering sentiment analysis methodology, synergizing BERT's contextual embeddings with a Multichannel Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) incorporated within an intricate deep neural network framework. Our proposed strategy adeptly unravels subtle emotional subtleties, capturing the complexity of expressions such as sarcasm and negation. A comprehensive set of experiments conducted across four distinct datasets substantiates the superiority of our approach over existing techniques, as evidenced by marked improvements in pivotal performance metrics including F1-score, accuracy, and precision. In a comparative analysis, our MCNN-BRNN model demonstrates exceptional prowess, outstripping the performance of other embedding methodologies like Word2Vec and Glove. Furthermore, when juxtaposed with the findings from previous studies, our model exhibits stellar performance, underscoring its effectiveness. This research significantly propels the field of sentiment analysis forward, finding applicability in diverse domains ranging from social media monitoring to product review analysis and customer feedback assessment. The BERT-Bi-GRU architecture embedded within our model with (MCNN) addresses complex challenges in natural language processing, seamlessly integrating global context with local features. This highlights the indispensable role of advanced deep-learning techniques in enhancing the precision and effectiveness of sentiment analysis. © 2023 IEEE.},

To evaluate the dataset, first, it has been categorized then the F1-Score of polarity detection of each category has been presented by applying both deep learning and supervised learning classifiers. The PWWA (Priority Word Weight Assignment) algorithm has been used to increase the model accuracy.

The sheer volume of customer reviews on the web produces information overload for readers. Developing a system that can automatically identify the most helpful reviews would be valuable to businesses that are interested in gathering informative and meaningful customer feedback. Because the target variable-review helpfulness-is continuous, common feature selection techniques from text classification cannot be applied. In this article, we propose and investigate a text mining model, enhanced using the Regressional ReliefF (RReliefF) feature selection method, for predicting the helpfulness of online reviews from Amazon.com. We find that RReliefF significantly outperforms two popular dimension reduction methods. This study is the first to investigate and compare different dimension reduction techniques in the context of applying text regression for predicting online review helpfulness. Another contribution is that our analysis of the keywords selected by RReliefF reveals meaningful feature groupings. © 2012 ACM.},

Those customers' feedbacks have been widely recognized as valuable information sources for improving service quality. Due to the sparse distribution of customer complaints and diversity of topics related to non-complaints in social media, manually identifying complaints is timeconsuming and inefficient. In this study, a supervised learning approach including samples enlargement and classifiers construct was proposed. Applying small labeled samples as training samples, reliable complaints samples and non-complaints samples were identified from the unlabeled dataset during the sample enlargement process. Combining the enlarged samples and the labeled samples, SVM and KNN algorithms were employed to construct the classifier. Empirical results show that the proposed approach can efficiently distinguish complaints from non-complaints in social media, especially when the number of labeled samples is very small. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Product innovation and design is often regarded as an information and knowledge intensive activity. While existing tools, i.e. search engines and product data management systems, have provided a certain degree of assistance to design community in information storage, processing and retrieval, many challenges remain, especially if we intend to provide advanced capabilities so that the designers are able to handle the overloaded information. These capabilities include, but are not restricted to, automated classification of design relevant documents based on product architecture, relevance analysis and summarization of design documents, identification of product function from customer feedback\reviews in conceptual design, personal design information subscription and management, market analysis and competitive intelligence report generation and so on. To fulfill these demands, an integrated text mining system for knowledge discovery and management in product design is proposed. In this paper, we report our study on the integration of online information with the internal knowledge base, e.g. product taxonomy, as part of our efforts towards the realization of the proposed system. Several key techniques are explained, i.e. maximal frequent word sequence algorithm in discovering the quality phrases, document profile model based on salient semantic information and finally concept based automated text classification approach. Experimental studies have demonstrated its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Prompt and knowledgeable responses to customers' email are critical in maximizing customer satisfaction. Such messages often contain complaints about unfair treatment due to negligence, incompetence, rigid protocols, unfriendly systems, and unresponsive personnel. In this paper, we refer to these email messages as emotional email. They provide valuable feedback to improve contact center efficiency and the quality of the overall customer care experience, which in turn results in increased customer retention. We describe a method that uses salient features to identify emotional email in the customer care domain. Salient features in customer care related email are expressions of customer frustration, dissatisfaction with the business, and threats to either leave, take legal action, and/or report to authorities. Compared to a baseline system using word unigram features, our proposed approach significantly improves emotional email detection performance. © 2012 AT&T Labs, Inc.},

	abstract = {Many applications in text processing require significant human effort for either labeling large document collections (when learning statistical models) or extrapolating rules from them (when using knowledge engineering). In this work, we describe a way to reduce this effort, while retaining the methods' accuracy, by constructing a hybrid classifier that utilizes human reasoning over automatically discovered text patterns to complement machine learning. Using a standard sentiment-classification dataset and real customer feedback data, we demonstrate that the resulting technique results in significant reduction of the human effort required to obtain a given classification accuracy. Moreover, the hybrid text classifier also results in a significant boost in accuracy over machine-learning based classifiers when a comparable amount of labeled data is used. Copyright 2006 ACM.},
